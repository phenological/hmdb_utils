Methylamino acids are primarily proteogenic amino acids (found in proteins) which have been methylated (in situ) on their side chains by various methyltransferase enzymes. Histidine can be methylated at either the N1 or N3 position of its imidazole ring, yielding the isomers 1-methylhistidine (1MH; also referred to as pi-methylhistidine) or 3-methylhistidine (3MH; tau-methylhistidine), respectively. There is considerable confusion with regard to the nomenclature of the methylated nitrogen atoms on the imidazole ring of histidine and other histidine-containing peptides such as anserine. In particular, older literature (mostly prior to the year 2000) designated anserine (Npi methylated) as beta-alanyl-N1-methyl-histidine, whereas according to standard IUPAC nomenclature, anserine is correctly named as beta-alanyl-N3-methyl-histidine. As a result, many papers published prior to the year 2000 incorrectly identified 1MH as a specific marker for dietary consumption or various pathophysiological effects when they really were referring to 3MH (PMID: 24137022).  Recent discoveries have shown that 1MH is produced in essentially all mammals (and other vertebrates) via the enzyme known as METTL9 (PMID: 33563959). METTL9 is a broad-specificity methyltransferase that mediates the formation of the majority of 1MH present in mammalian proteomes. METTL9-catalyzed methylation requires a His-x-His (HxH) motif, where ""x"" is a small amino acid. This HxH motif is found in a number of abundant mammalian proteins such as ARMC6, S100A9, and NDUFB3 (PMID: 33563959). Because of its abundance in many muscle-related proteins, 1MH has been found to be a good biomarker for the consumption of meat (PMID: 21527577). Dietary studies have shown that poultry consumption (p-trend = 0.0006) and chicken consumption (p-trend = 0.0003) are associated with increased levels of 1MH in human plasma (PMID: 30018457). The consumption of fish, especially salmon and cod, has also been shown to increase the levels of 1MH in serum and urine (PMID: 31401679). As a general rule, urinary 1MH is associated with white meat intake (p< 0.001), whereas urinary 3MH is associated with red meat intake (p< 0.001) (PMID: 34091671).",HMDB0000001_nmroned_1022_27891.txt,nmroned,1-methylhistidine (2s)-2-amino-3-(1-methyl-1h-imidazol-4-yl)propanoic acid pi-methylhistidine (2s)-2-amino-3-(1-methyl-1h-imidazol-4-yl)propanoate 1 methylhistidine 1-methyl histidine 1-methyl-histidine 1-methyl-l-histidine 1-mhis 1-n-methyl-l-histidine l-1-methylhistidine n1-methyl-l-histidine 1-methylhistidine dihydrochloride 1-methylhistidine

Oxidative stress or detoxification of xenobiotics in the liver can dramatically increase the rate of hepatic glutathione synthesis. Under such metabolic stress conditions, supplies of L-cysteine for glutathione synthesis become limiting, so homocysteine is diverted from the transmethylation pathway (which forms methionine) into the transsulfuration pathway (which forms cystathionine). alpha-Ketobutyrate is released as a byproduct when cystathionine is cleaved into cysteine that is incorporated into glutathione. Chronic shifts in the rate of glutathione synthesis may be reflected by urinary excretion of 2-hydroxybutyrate. 2-Hydroxybutyrate is an early marker for both insulin resistance and impaired glucose regulation that appears to arise due to increased lipid oxidation and oxidative stress (PMID: 20526369). 2-Hydroxybutyric acid is often found in the urine of patients suffering from lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis. 2-Hydroxybutyric acid generally appears at high concentrations in situations related to deficient energy metabolism (e.g. birth asphyxia) and also in inherited metabolic diseases affecting the central nervous system during neonatal development, such as ""cerebral"" lactic acidosis, glutaric aciduria type II, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) deficiency, and propionic acidemia. More recently it has been noted that elevated levels of alpha-hydroxybutyrate in the plasma is a good marker for early-stage type II diabetes (PMID: 19166731). It was concluded from studies done in the mid-1970s that an increased NADH2/NAD ratio was the most important factor for the production of 2-hydroxybutyric acid (PMID: 168632).",HMDB0000008_nmroned_5245_2734397.txt,nmroned,2-hydroxybutyric acid (s)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid 2-hydroxybutyrate 2-hydroxybutyric acid l-2-hydroxybutanoic acid l-2-hydroxybutyric acid l-alpha-hydroxybutanoic acid l-alpha-hydroxybutyric acid (s)-2-hydroxybutanoate l-2-hydroxybutanoate l-2-hydroxybutyrate l-a-hydroxybutanoate l-a-hydroxybutanoic acid l-alpha-hydroxybutanoate l-α-hydroxybutanoate l-α-hydroxybutanoic acid l-a-hydroxybutyrate l-a-hydroxybutyric acid l-alpha-hydroxybutyrate l-α-hydroxybutyrate l-α-hydroxybutyric acid (s)-2-hydroxybutyrate 2-hydroxybutanoate (+)-2-hydroxy-n-butyric acid (+)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid (+)-2-hydroxybutyric acid (+)-alpha-hydroxybutyric acid (+)-α-hydroxybutyric acid (2s)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid (s)-(+)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid (s)-2-hydroxybutyric acid 2-hydroxybutanoic acid alpha-hydroxy-n-butyric acid alpha-hydroxybutanoic acid alpha-hydroxybutyric acid α-hydroxy-n-butyric acid α-hydroxybutanoic acid α-hydroxybutyric acid

This acid is metabolized by 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (catalyzes the oxidation of 3-hydroxybutyrate to form acetoacetate, using NAD+ as an electron acceptor). The enzyme functions in nervous tissues and muscles, enabling the use of circulating hydroxybutyrate as a fuel. In the liver mitochondrial matrix, the enzyme can also catalyze the reverse reaction, a step in ketogenesis. 3-Hydroxybutyric acid is a chiral compound having two enantiomers, D-3-hydroxybutyric acid and L-3-hydroxybutyric acid, and is a ketone body. Like the other ketone bodies (acetoacetate and acetone), levels of 3-hydroxybutyrate in blood and urine are raised in ketosis. In humans, 3-hydroxybutyrate is synthesized in the liver from acetyl-CoA and can be used as an energy source by the brain when blood glucose is low. Blood levels of 3-hydroxybutyric acid levels may be monitored in diabetic patients to look for diabetic ketoacidosis. Persistent mild hyperketonemia is a common finding in newborns. Ketone bodies serve as an indispensable source of energy for extrahepatic tissues, especially the brain and lung of developing mammals. Another important function of ketone bodies is to provide acetoacetyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA for the synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids, and complex lipids. During the early postnatal period, acetoacetate (AcAc) and beta-hydroxybutyrate are preferred over glucose as substrates for the synthesis of phospholipids and sphingolipids in accord with requirements for brain growth and myelination. Thus, during the first two weeks of postnatal development, when the accumulation of cholesterol and phospholipids accelerates, the proportion of ketone bodies incorporated into these lipids increases. On the other hand, an increased proportion of ketone bodies is utilized for cerebroside synthesis during the period of active myelination. In the lung, AcAc serves better than glucose as a precursor for the synthesis of lung phospholipids. The synthesized lipids, particularly dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, are incorporated into surfactant, and thus have a potential role in supplying adequate surfactant lipids to maintain lung function during the early days of life (PMID: 3884391). 3-Hydroxybutyric acid is found to be associated with fumarase deficiency and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, which are inborn errors of metabolism. 3-Hydroxybutyric acid is a metabolite of Alcaligenes and can be produced from plastic metabolization or incorporated into polymers, depending on the species (PMID: 7646009, 18615882).",HMDB0000011_nmroned_1027_27912.txt,nmroned,3-hydroxybutyric acid (r)-(-)-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (r)-3-hydroxybutanoic acid 3-d-hydroxybutyric acid d-3-hydroxybutyric acid d-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (r)-(-)-b-hydroxybutyrate (r)-(-)-b-hydroxybutyric acid (r)-(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate (r)-(-)-β-hydroxybutyrate (r)-(-)-β-hydroxybutyric acid (r)-3-hydroxybutanoate 3-d-hydroxybutyrate d-3-hydroxybutyrate d-b-hydroxybutyrate d-b-hydroxybutyric acid d-beta-hydroxybutyrate d-β-hydroxybutyrate d-β-hydroxybutyric acid (r)-3-hydroxybutyrate 3-delta-hydroxybutyrate 3-delta-hydroxybutyric acid bhib d-(-)-3-hydroxybutyrate delta-(-)-3-hydroxybutyrate delta-3-hydroxybutyrate delta-3-hydroxybutyric acid delta-beta-hydroxybutyrate 3r-hydroxy-butanoate (r)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (-)-3-hydroxy-n-butyric acid (-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (3r)-3-hydroxybutanoic acid (3r)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (3r)-hydroxybutyrate (r)-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (r)-beta-hydroxybutanoic acid (r)-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (r)-β-hydroxybutanoic acid (r)-β-hydroxybutyric acid 3-hydroxy-n-butyric acid 3-hydroxybutanoic acid 3-hydroxybutyric acid 3r-hydroxybutanoic acid d-(-)-3-hydroxybutanoic acid d-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid d-(-)-beta-hydroxybutyric acid d-(-)-β-hydroxybutyric acid beta-hydroxy-n-butyric acid beta-hydroxybutanoic acid beta-hydroxybutyric acid β-hydroxy-n-butyric acid β-hydroxybutanoic acid β-hydroxybutyric acid

Deoxyuridine is considered to be an antimetabolite that is converted into deoxyuridine triphosphate during DNA synthesis. Laboratory suppression of deoxyuridine is used to diagnose megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies. In humans, deoxyuridine is involved in the metabolic disorder called UMP synthase deficiency (orotic aciduria). Outside of the human body, deoxyuridine has been detected, but not quantified in, several different foods, such as lichee, highbush blueberries, agaves, macadamia nut (M. tetraphylla), and red bell peppers.

Pyrimidine 2'-deoxyribonucleosides are compounds consisting of a pyrimidine linked to a ribose which lacks a hydroxyl group at position 2. Deoxycytidine is also classified as a deoxyribonucleoside, a component of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Deoxycytidine is similar to the ribonucleoside cytidine, but with one hydroxyl group removed from the 2' position. Deoxycytidine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Degradation of DNA through apoptosis or cell death produces deoxycytidine. Within humans, deoxycytidine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, deoxycytidine can be biosynthesized from dCMP through the action of the enzyme cytosolic purine 5'-nucleotidase. In addition, deoxycytidine can be converted into dCMP; which is mediated by the enzyme uridine-cytidine kinase-like 1. Deoxycytidine can be phosphorylated at the C-5 position by the enzyme deoxycytidine kinase to produce deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP), and to a lesser extent, deoxycytidine diphosphate (dCDP), and deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP). Deoxycytidine can also be phosphorylated by thymidine kinase 2 (TK2). Deoxycytidine can potentially be used for the treatment of the metabolic disorder known as thymidine kinase 2 deficiency (TK2 deficiency). TK2 deficiency has three disease subtypes: i) infantile-onset myopathy with rapid progression to early death ii) childhood-onset myopathy, which resembles spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type III, begins between ages 1 and 12 years with progression to loss of ambulation within few years and iii) late-onset myopathy starting at age 12 year or later with moderate to severe myopathy manifesting as either isolated chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) or a generalized myopathy with CPEO plus facial and limb weakness, gradual progression, and, in some cases, respiratory failure and loss of ability to walk in adulthood (PMID: 28318037).

A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of alpha-ketoisovaleric acid are associated with maple syrup urine disease. MSUD is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), leading to a buildup of the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and their toxic by-products (ketoacids) in the blood and urine. The symptoms of MSUD often show in infancy and lead to severe brain damage if untreated. MSUD may also present later depending on the severity of the disease. If left untreated in older individuals, during times of metabolic crisis, symptoms of the condition include uncharacteristically inappropriate, extreme, or erratic behaviour and moods, hallucinations, anorexia, weight loss, anemia, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, oscillating hypertonia and hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, opisthotonus, pancreatitis, rapid neurological decline, and coma.  In maple syrup urine disease, the brain concentration of branched-chain ketoacids can increase 10- to 20-fold. This leads to a depletion of glutamate and a consequent reduction in the concentration of brain glutamine, aspartate, alanine, and other amino acids. The result is a compromise of energy metabolism because of a failure of the malate-aspartate shuttle and a diminished rate of protein synthesis (PMID: 15930465). alpha-Ketoisovaleric acid is a keto-acid, which is a subclass of organic acids. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated MSUD.

Biotin is also known as coenzyme R and vitamin H or B7. It occurs mainly bound to proteins or polypeptides and is abundant in liver, kidney, pancreas, yeast, and milk. Biotin has been recognized as an essential nutrient. Humans fulfill their biotin requirement through their diet through endogenous reutilization of biotin and perhaps through the capture of biotin generated in the intestinal flora. The utilization of biotin for covalent attachment to carboxylases and its reutilization through the release of carboxylase biotin after proteolytic degradation constitutes the 'biotin cycle'. Biotin deficiency is associated with neurological manifestations, skin rash, hair loss, and metabolic disturbances that are thought to relate to the various carboxylase deficiencies (metabolic ketoacidosis with lactic acidosis). It has also been suggested that biotin deficiency is associated with protein malnutrition, and that marginal biotin deficiency in pregnant women may be teratogenic. Biotin acts as a carboxyl carrier in carboxylation reactions. There are four biotin-dependent carboxylases in mammals: those of propionyl-CoA (PCC), 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA (MCC), pyruvate (PC), and acetyl-CoA carboxylases (isoforms ACC-1 and ACC-2). All but ACC-2 are mitochondrial enzymes. The biotin moiety is covalently bound to the epsilon amino group of a lysine residue in each of these carboxylases in a domain 60-80 amino acids long. The domain is structurally similar among carboxylases from bacteria to mammals. Evidence is emerging that biotin participates in processes other than classical carboxylation reactions. Specifically, novel roles for biotin in cell signalling, gene expression, and chromatin structure have been identified in recent years. Human cells accumulate biotin by using both the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter and monocarboxylate transporter 1. These transporters and other biotin-binding proteins partition biotin to compartments involved in biotin signalling: cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nuclei. The activity of cell signals such as biotinyl-AMP, Sp1 and Sp3, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, and receptor tyrosine kinases depends on biotin supply. Consistent with a role for biotin and its catabolites in modulating these cell signals, greater than 2000 biotin-dependent genes have been identified in various human tissues. Many biotin-dependent gene products play roles in signal transduction and localize to the cell nucleus, consistent with a role for biotin in cell signalling. Posttranscriptional events related to ribosomal activity and protein folding may further contribute to the effects of biotin on gene expression. Finally, research has shown that biotinidase and holocarboxylase synthetase mediate covalent binding of biotin to histones (DNA-binding proteins), affecting chromatin structure; at least seven biotinylation sites have been identified in human histones. Biotinylation of histones appears to play a role in cell proliferation, gene silencing, and the cellular response to DNA repair. Roles for biotin in cell signalling and chromatin structure are consistent with the notion that biotin has a unique significance in cell biology (PMID: 15992684, 16011464).",HMDB0000030_nmroned_1039_27963.txt,nmroned,"biotin (+)-cis-hexahydro-2-oxo-1h-thieno[3,4]imidazole-4-valeric acid (3as,4s,6ar)-hexahydro-2-oxo-1h-thieno[3,4-d]imidazole-4-valeric acid 5-(2-oxohexahydro-1h-thieno[3,4-d]imidazol-4-yl)pentanoic acid biotina biotine biotinum cis-(+)-tetrahydro-2-oxothieno[3,4]imidazoline-4-valeric acid cis-hexahydro-2-oxo-1h-thieno(3,4)imidazole-4-valeric acid cis-tetrahydro-2-oxothieno(3,4-d)imidazoline-4-valeric acid coenzyme r d-(+)-biotin d-biotin vitamin b7 vitamin h bioepiderm (+)-cis-hexahydro-2-oxo-1h-thieno[3,4]imidazole-4-valerate (3as,4s,6ar)-hexahydro-2-oxo-1h-thieno[3,4-d]imidazole-4-valerate 5-(2-oxohexahydro-1h-thieno[3,4-d]imidazol-4-yl)pentanoate cis-(+)-tetrahydro-2-oxothieno[3,4]imidazoline-4-valerate cis-hexahydro-2-oxo-1h-thieno(3,4)imidazole-4-valerate cis-tetrahydro-2-oxothieno(3,4-d)imidazoline-4-valerate (+)-biotin -(+)-biotin 1swk 1swn 1swr biodermatin bios h bios ii d(+)-biotin d-biotin factor s delta-(+)-biotin delta-biotin delta-biotin factor s factor s factor s (vitamin) hexahydro-2-oxo-1h-thieno(3,4-d)imidazole-4-pentanoate hexahydro-2-oxo-1h-thieno(3,4-d)imidazole-4-pentanoic acid hexahydro-2-oxo-[3as-(3aa,4b,6aa)]-1h-thieno[3,4-d]imidazole-4-pentanoate hexahydro-2-oxo-[3as-(3aa,4b,6aa)]-1h-thieno[3,4-d]imidazole-4-pentanoic acid hexahydro-2-oxo-[3as-(3alpha,4beta,6alpha)]-1h-thieno[3,4-d]imidazole-4-pentanoate hexahydro-2-oxo-[3as-(3alpha,4beta,6alpha)]-1h-thieno[3,4-d]imidazole-4-pentanoic acid lutavit h2 meribin rovimix h 2 vitamin-h biotin hermes brand biotin roche brand biotin simons brand biotin strathmann brand biotin ziethen brand biotin ratiopharm roche brand of biotin roche, biotine e+b pharma brand of biotin medobiotin biokur biotinratiopharm gelfert, biotin hermes brand of biotin hermes, biotin medopharm brand of biotin ratiopharm brand of biotin biocur brand of biotin biotin dermapharm brand biotine roche deacura dermapharm brand of biotin gabunat medebiotin rombellin ziethen brand of biotin biotin biocur brand biotin gelfert biotin hermes biotin medopharm brand biotin ratiopharm brand biotin-ratiopharm h, vitamin medea brand of biotin sodium salt simons brand of biotin strathmann brand of biotin"

Cholesterols and derivatives are compounds containing a 3-hydroxylated cholestane core. Thus, 7-dehydrocholesterol is also classified as a sterol. 7-Dehydrocholesterol is known as a zoosterol, meaning that it is a sterol isolated from animals (to distinguish those sterols isolated from plants which are called phytosterols). 7-DHC functions in the serum as a cholesterol precursor and is photochemically converted to vitamin D3 in the skin. Therefore 7-DHC functions as provitamin-D3. The presence of 7-DHC in human skin enables humans and other mammals to manufacture vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) from ultraviolet rays in the sun light, via an intermediate isomer pre-vitamin D3. 7-DHC absorbs UV light most effectively at wavelengths between 290 and 320 nm and, thus, the production of vitamin D3 will occur primarily at those wavelengths (PMID: 9625080).  The two most important factors that govern the generation of pre-vitamin D3 are the quantity (intensity) and quality (appropriate wavelength) of the UVB irradiation reaching the 7-dehydrocholesterol deep in the stratum basale and stratum spinosum (PMID: 9625080). 7-DHC is also found in the milk of several mammalian species, including cows (PMID: 10999630; PMID: 225459). It was discovered by Nobel-laureate organic chemist Adolf Windaus. 7-DHC can be produced by animals and plants via different pathways (PMID: 23717318).

It is found exclusively in animal tissues and is naturally produced in the body by the liver. Carnosine has a pKa value of 6.83, making it a good buffer for the pH range of animal muscles.  Since beta-alanine is a non-proteogenic amino acid and is not incorporated into proteins, carnosine can be stored at relatively high concentrations (millimolar) in muscles, with concentrations as high as 17‚Äì25 mmol/kg (dry muscle). Carnosine is also highly concentrated in brain tissues. Carnosine has been shown to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as alpha-beta unsaturated aldehydes formed from peroxidation of fatty acids during oxidative stress. The antioxidant mechanism of carnosine is attributed to its chelating effect against divalent metal ions, superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity, as well as its ROS and free radicals scavenging ability (PMID: 16406688). Carnosine also buffers muscle cells, and acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain. Carnosine has the potential to suppress many of the biochemical changes that accompany ageing (e.g. protein oxidation, glycation, AGE formation, and cross-linking) and associated pathologies (PMID: 16804013). Some autistic patients take carnosine as a dietary supplement and attribute an improvement in their condition to it. Supplemental carnosine may increase corticosterone levels. This may explain the ""hyperactivity"" seen in autistic subjects at higher doses. A positive association between muscle tissue carnosine concentration and exercise performance has been found. Œ≤-Alanine supplementation is thought increase exercise performance by promoting carnosine production in muscle. Exercise has conversely been found to increase muscle carnosine concentrations, and muscle carnosine content is higher in athletes engaging in anaerobic exercise. Carnosine is also a biomarker for the consumption of meat. Elevated levels of urinary and plasma carnosine are associated with carnosinuria (also known as carnosinemia), which is an inborn error of metabolism. caused by a deficiency of the enzyme carnosinase. Carnosinas cleaves carnosine into its constituent amino acids: Œ≤-Alanine and histidine. Carnonsinemia results in an excess of carnosine in the urine, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and nervous tissue.

It is a straight-chain alkyl carboxylic acid that appears as an oily, colorless liquid with an unpleasant (rancid butter) odor. The name butyric acid comes from the Greek word for ""butter"", the substance in which it was first found. Triglycerides of butyric acid constitute 3‚Äì4% of butter. When butter goes rancid, butyric acid is liberated from the short-chain triglycerides via hydrolysis. Butyric acid is a widely distributed SCFA and is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals. It is present in animal fat and plant oils, bovine milk, breast milk, butter, parmesan cheese, body odor and vomit. While butyric acid has an unpleasant odor, it does have a pleasant buttery taste. As a result, butyric acid is used as a flavoring agent in food manufacturing. Low-molecular-weight esters of butyric acid, such as methyl butyrate, also have very pleasant aromas or tastes. As a result, several butyrate esters are used as food and perfume additives. Butyrate is naturally produced by fermentation processes performed by obligate anaerobic bacteria found in the mammalian gut. It is a metabolite of several bacterial genera including Anaerostipes, Coprococcus, Eubacterium, Faecalibacterium and Roseburia (PMID: 12324374; PMID: 27446020). Highly-fermentable fiber residues, such as those from resistant starch, oat bran, pectin, and guar can be transformed by colonic bacteria into butyrate. One study found that resistant starch consistently produces more butyrate than other types of dietary fibre (PMID: 14747692). The production of butyrate from fibres in ruminant animals such as cattle is responsible for the butyrate content of milk and butter. Butyrate has a number of important biological functions and binds to several specific receptors. In humans, butyric acid is one of two primary endogenous agonists of human hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2), a G protein-coupled receptor. Like other SCFAs, butyrate is also an agonist at the free fatty acid receptors FFAR2 and FFAR3, which function as nutrient sensors that facilitate the homeostatic control of energy balance. Butyrate is essential to host immune homeostasis (PMID: 25875123). Butyrate's effects on the immune system are mediated through the inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (specifically, HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8) and activation of its G-protein coupled receptor targets including HCA2, FFAR2 and FFAR3. Among the short-chain fatty acids, butyrate is the most potent promoter of intestinal regulatory T cells in vitro and the only SCFA that is an HCA2 ligand (PMID: 25741338). Butyrate has been shown to be a critical mediator of the colonic inflammatory response. It possesses both preventive and therapeutic potential to counteract inflammation-mediated ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer. As a short-chain fatty acid, butyrate is metabolized by mitochondria as an energy source through fatty acid metabolism. In particular, it is an important energy source for cells lining the mammalian colon (colonocytes). Without butyrate, colon cells undergo autophagy (i.e., self-digestion) and die.",HMDB0000039_nmroned_1047_28002.txt,nmroned,"butyric acid 1-butanoic acid 1-butyric acid 1-propanecarboxylic acid 4:0 acide butanoique acide butyrique butanic acid butanoate butanoic acid butoic acid buttersaeure c4:0 ch3-[ch2]2-cooh ethylacetic acid n-butanoic acid n-butyric acid propanecarboxylic acid propylformic acid butyrate 1-butanoate 1-butyrate 1-propanecarboxylate butanate butoate ethylacetate n-butanoate n-butyrate propanecarboxylate propylformate honey robber kyselina maselna butyrate, magnesium magnesium butyrate acid, butyric butyrate, sodium dibutyrate, magnesium magnesium dibutyrate sodium butyrate acid, butanoic butyric acid magnesium salt butyric acid, sodium salt fa(4:0) butyric acid"

It is the smallest short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and one of the simplest carboxylic acids. is an acidic, colourless liquid and is the main component in vinegar. Acetic acid has a sour taste and pungent smell. It is an important chemical reagent and industrial chemical that is used in the production of plastic soft drink bottles, photographic film; and polyvinyl acetate for wood glue, as well as many synthetic fibres and fabrics. In households diluted acetic acid is often used as a cleaning agent. In the food industry acetic acid is used as an acidity regulator. Acetic acid is found in all organisms, from bacteria to plants to humans. The acetyl group, derived from acetic acid, is fundamental to the biochemistry of virtually all forms of life. When bound to coenzyme A (to form acetylCoA) it is central to the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. However, the concentration of free acetic acid in cells is kept at a low level to avoid disrupting the control of the pH of the cell contents. Acetic acid is produced and excreted in large amounts by certain acetic acid bacteria, notably the Acetobacter genus and Clostridium acetobutylicum. These bacteria are found universally in foodstuffs, water, and soil. Due to their widespread presence on fruit, acetic acid is produced naturally as fruits and many other sugar-rich foods spoil. Several species of anaerobic bacteria, including members of the genus Clostridium and Acetobacterium can convert sugars to acetic acid directly. However, Clostridium bacteria are less acid-tolerant than Acetobacter. Even the most acid-tolerant Clostridium strains can produce acetic acid in concentrations of only a few per cent, compared to Acetobacter strains that can produce acetic acid in concentrations up to 20%. Acetic acid is also a component of the vaginal lubrication of humans and other primates, where it appears to serve as a mild antibacterial agent. Acetic acid can be found in other biofluids such as urine at low concentrations. Urinary acetic acid is produced by bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B, Staphylococcus saprophyticus (PMID: 22292465). Acetic acid concentrations greater than 30 uM/mM creatinine in the urine can indicate a urinary tract infection, which typically suggests the presence of E. coli or Klebshiella pneumonia in the urinary tract. (PMID: 24909875) Acetic acid is also produced by other bacteria such as Akkermansia, Bacteroidetes, Bifidobacterium, Prevotella and Ruminococcus (PMID: 20444704; PMID: 22292465).",HMDB0000042_nmroned_1048_28007.txt,nmroned,"acetic acid acide acetique acoh ch3-cooh ch3co2h e 260 e-260 e260 essigsaeure ethanoic acid ethoic acid ethylic acid hoac ins no. 260 meco2h mecooh methanecarboxylic acid glacial acetic acid acetasol ethanoate ethoate ethylate methanecarboxylate glacial acetate acetate kyselina octova vinegar vinegar acid acid, acetic acetic acid glacial acid glacial, acetic acid, glacial acetic acetic acid, glacial glacial, acetic acid"

It is a small N-trimethylated amino acid, existing in zwitterionic form at neutral pH. It is now often called glycine betaine to distinguish it from other betaines that are widely distributed in microorganisms, plants, and animals. Many naturally occurring betaines serve as organic osmolytes, substances synthesized or taken up from the environment by cells for protection against osmotic stress, drought, high salinity, or high temperature. Intracellular accumulation of betaines permits water retention in cells, thus protecting from the effects of dehydration (Wikipedia). Betaine functions as a methyl donor in that it carries and donates methyl functional groups to facilitate necessary chemical processes. In particular, it methylates homocysteine to methionine, also producing N,N-dimethylglycine. The donation of methyl groups is important to proper liver function, cellular replication, and detoxification reactions. Betaine also plays a role in the manufacture of carnitine and serves to protect the kidneys from damage. Betaine comes from either the diet or by the oxidation of choline. Betaine insufficiency is associated with metabolic syndrome, lipid disorders, and diabetes, and may have a role in vascular and other diseases (PMID: 20346934). Betaine is important in development, from the pre-implantation embryo to infancy. Betaine is also widely regarded as an anti-oxidant. Betaine has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on NO release in activated microglial cells and may be an effective therapeutic component to control neurological disorders (PMID: 22801281). As a drug, betaine hydrochloride has been used as a source of hydrochloric acid in the treatment of hypochlorhydria.

Adenosine or adenosine derivatives play many important biological roles in addition to being components of DNA and RNA. For instance, adenosine plays an important role in energy transfer as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). It also plays a role in signal transduction as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Adenosine itself is both a neurotransmitter and potent vasodilator. When administered intravenously adenosine causes transient heart block in the AV node. Due to the effects of adenosine on AV node-dependent supraventricular tachycardia, adenosine is considered a class V antiarrhythmic agent. Overdoses of adenosine intake (as a drug) can lead to several side effects including chest pain, feeling faint, shortness of breath, and tingling of the senses. Serious side effects include a worsening dysrhythmia and low blood pressure. When present in sufficiently high levels, adenosine can act as an immunotoxin and a metabotoxin. An immunotoxin disrupts, limits the function, or destroys immune cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenous metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of adenosine are associated with adenosine deaminase deficiency. Adenosine is a precursor to deoxyadenosine, which is a precursor to dATP. A buildup of dATP in cells inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and prevents DNA synthesis, so cells are unable to divide. Since developing T cells and B cells are some of the most mitotically active cells, they are unable to divide and propagate to respond to immune challenges.

The enzyme that catalyzes the reaction is argininosuccinate synthetase. Argininosuccinic acid is a precursor to fumarate in the citric acid cycle via argininosuccinate lyase. Defects in the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme can lead to argininosuccinate lyase deficiency, which is an inborn error of metabolism. Argininosuccinate (ASA) lyase deficiency results in defective cleavage of ASA. This leads to an accumulation of ASA in cells and an excessive excretion of ASA in urine (argininosuccinic aciduria). In virtually all respects, this disorder shares the characteristics of other urea cycle defects. The most important characteristic of ASA lyase deficiency is its propensity to cause hyperammonemia in affected individuals. ASA in affected individuals is excreted by the kidney at a rate practically equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Whether ASA itself causes a degree of toxicity due to hepatocellular accumulation is unknown; such an effect could help explain hyperammonemia development in affected individuals. Regardless, the name of the disease is derived from the rapid clearance of ASA in urine, although elevated levels of ASA can be found in plasma. ASA lyase deficiency is associated with high mortality and morbidity rates. Symptoms of ASA lyase deficiency include anorexia, irritability rapid breathing, lethargy and vomiting.

It occurs in the normal catabolic pathway that breaks down heme in vertebrates. This catabolism is a necessary process in the body's clearance of waste products that arise from the destruction of aged or abnormal red blood cells. Bilirubin has been found in all vertebrates and in certain plants including Strelitzia nicolai (PMID: 28573242). Bilirubin levels in humans are elevated in certain diseases such as jaundice and liver disease and it is responsible for the yellow color of bruises and the yellow discoloration in jaundice. Bilirubin breakdown products, such as stercobilin, cause the brown color of feces. A different breakdown product, urobilin, is the main component of the straw-yellow color in urine. Bilirubin consists of an open chain of four pyrroles (tetrapyrrole). It is formed by oxidative cleavage of a porphyrin in heme, which leads to biliverdin, a green tetrapyrrolic bile pigment that is also a product of heme catabolism. Biliverdin is then reduced to bilirubin via biliverdin reductase. After conjugation with glucuronic acid, bilirubin can be excreted in the urine. Bilirubin is structurally similar to the pigment phycobilin used by certain algae to capture light energy, and to the pigment phytochrome used by plants to sense light. Elevated bilirubin levels in humans are associated with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I, which is an inborn error of metabolism. Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by an inability to properly convert and clear bilirubin from the body. Affected individuals cannot convert unconjugated bilirubin to the conjugated form because they lack a specific liver enzyme required to break down (metabolize) bilirubin. Since they cannot convert bilirubin, they develop abnormally high levels of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia). Crigler-Najjar syndrome is caused by mutations in the UGT1A1 gene. The hallmark finding of Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a persistent yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes and whites of the eyes (jaundice). Elevation of both alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin levels in serum or plasma can be indicative of serious liver injury. High levels of bilirubin are indicative of jaundice, which is easily recognizable due to a yellowing of the skin and eyes.  Bilirubin is also an antioxidant. Bilirubin's antioxidant activity may be particularly important in the brain, where it prevents excitotoxicity and neuronal death by scavenging superoxide during N-methyl-D-aspartic acid neurotransmission (PMID: 31353321).",HMDB0000054_nmroned_1056_28045.txt,nmroned,"bilirubin 1,10,19,22,23,24-hexahydro-2,7,13,17-tetramethyl-1,19-dioxo-3,18-divinylbiline-8,12-dipropionic acid 2,17-diethenyl-1,10,19,22,23,24-hexahydro-3,7,13,18-tetramethyl-1,19-dioxo-21h-biline-8,12-dipropanoic acid 2,7,13,17-tetramethyl-1,19-dioxo-3,18-divinyl-1,10,19,22,23,24-hexahydro-21h-biline-8,12-dipropanoic acid 8,12-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-2,7,13,17-tetramethyl-3,18-divinylbiladiene-ac-1,19(21h,24h)-dione bilirubin(z,z) bilirubin-ixalpha 1,10,19,22,23,24-hexahydro-2,7,13,17-tetramethyl-1,19-dioxo-3,18-divinylbiline-8,12-dipropionate 2,17-diethenyl-1,10,19,22,23,24-hexahydro-3,7,13,18-tetramethyl-1,19-dioxo-21h-biline-8,12-dipropanoate 2,7,13,17-tetramethyl-1,19-dioxo-3,18-divinyl-1,10,19,22,23,24-hexahydro-21h-biline-8,12-dipropanoate bilirubin ixalpha (4z,15z)-bilirubin ixa (z,z)-bilirubin ixa 1,10,19,22,23,24-hexahydro-2,7,13,17-tetramethyl-1,19-dioxo-3,18-divinyl-biline-8,12-dipropionate 1,10,19,22,23,24-hexahydro-2,7,13,17-tetramethyl-1,19-dioxo-3,18-divinyl-biline-8,12-dipropionic acid 3-(2-((3-(2-carboxyethyl)-4-methyl-5-((3-methyl-5-oxo-4-vinyl-1,5-dihydro-2h-pyrrol-2-ylidene)methyl)-1h-pyrrol-2-yl)methyl)-4-methyl-5-((4-methyl-5-oxo-3-vinyl-1,5-dihydro-2h-pyrrol-2-ylidene)methyl)-1h-pyrrol-3-yl)propanoate 3-(2-((3-(2-carboxyethyl)-4-methyl-5-((3-methyl-5-oxo-4-vinyl-1,5-dihydro-2h-pyrrol-2-ylidene)methyl)-1h-pyrrol-2-yl)methyl)-4-methyl-5-((4-methyl-5-oxo-3-vinyl-1,5-dihydro-2h-pyrrol-2-ylidene)methyl)-1h-pyrrol-3-yl)propanoic acid 3-(2-((3-(2-carboxyethyl)-4-methyl-5-[(z)-(3-methyl-5-oxo-4-vinyl-1,5-dihydro-2h-pyrrol-2-ylidene)methyl]-1h-pyrrol-2-yl)methyl)-4-methyl-5-[(z)-(4-methyl-5-oxo-3-vinyl-1,5-dihydro-2h-pyrrol-2-ylidene 3-[2-[[3-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-[(3-ethenyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-pyrrol-2-ylidene)methyl]-4-methyl-1h-pyrrol-2-yl]methyl]-5-[(4-ethenyl-3-methyl-5-oxo-pyrrol-2-ylidene)methyl]-4-methyl-1h-pyrrol-3-yl]propanoate 3-[2-[[3-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-[(3-ethenyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-pyrrol-2-ylidene)methyl]-4-methyl-1h-pyrrol-2-yl]methyl]-5-[(4-ethenyl-3-methyl-5-oxo-pyrrol-2-ylidene)methyl]-4-methyl-1h-pyrrol-3-yl]propanoic acid 3-[2-[[3-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-[(z)-(3-ethenyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-pyrrol-2-ylidene)methyl]-4-methyl-1h-pyrrol-2-yl]methyl]-5-[(z)-(4-ethenyl-3-methyl-5-oxo-pyrrol-2-ylidene)methyl]-4-methyl-1h-pyrrol-3-yl]propanoate 3-[2-[[3-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-[(z)-(3-ethenyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-pyrrol-2-ylidene)methyl]-4-methyl-1h-pyrrol-2-yl]methyl]-5-[(z)-(4-ethenyl-3-methyl-5-oxo-pyrrol-2-ylidene)methyl]-4-methyl-1h-pyrrol-3-yl]propanoic acid bilirubin ix-alpha cholerythrin hematoidin bilirubin ix alpha"

It belongs to the class of organic compounds known as O-glycosyl compounds. These are glycosides in which a sugar group is bonded through one carbon to another group via a O-glycosidic bond. Cellobiose can be obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose and cellulose-rich materials such as cotton, jute, or paper. Cellobiose is a plant metabolite found in flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms. Cellobiose can also be found in vertebrates that have consumed plant foods. It has been detected, but not quantified in, several different foods, such as okra, common chokecherries, cherry tomatoes, and welsh onions. Cellobiose can be used as an indicator carbohydrate for Crohn's disease and malabsorption syndrome. Intestinal permeability to detect Crohn's disease and malabsorption syndrome can be measured by the sugar absorption test. This test is based on determining the ratio of the urinary excretion of a large (a disaccharide such as cellobiose) and a small carbohydrate (a monosaccharide such as lactulose or rhamnose) after oral administration.

It is formed in vivo by the degradation of dihydrouracil and carnosine. It is a component of the naturally occurring peptides carnosine and anserine and also of pantothenic acid (vitamin B-5), which itself is a component of coenzyme A. Under normal conditions, beta-alanine is metabolized into acetic acid. beta-Alanine can undergo a transanimation reaction with pyruvate to form malonate-semialdehyde and L-alanine. The malonate semialdehyde can then be converted into malonate via malonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase. Malonate is then converted into malonyl-CoA and enter fatty acid biosynthesis. Since neuronal uptake and neuronal receptor sensitivity to beta-alanine have been demonstrated, beta-alanine may act as a false transmitter replacing gamma-aminobutyric acid. When present in sufficiently high levels, beta-alanine can act as a neurotoxin, a mitochondrial toxin, and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that damages the brain or nerve tissue. A mitochondrial toxin is a compound that damages mitochondria and reduces cellular respiration as well as oxidative phosphorylation. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of beta-alanine are associated with at least three inborn errors of metabolism, including GABA-transaminase deficiency, hyper-beta-alaninemia, and methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency. beta-Alanine is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant and is an inhibitor of GABA transaminase. The associated inhibition of GABA transaminase and displacement of GABA from CNS binding sites can also lead to GABAuria (high levels of GABA in the urine) and convulsions. In addition to its neurotoxicity, beta-alanine reduces cellular levels of taurine, which are required for normal respiratory chain function. Cellular taurine depletion is known to reduce respiratory function and elevate mitochondrial superoxide generation, which damages mitochondria and increases oxidative stress (PMID: 27023909). Individuals suffering from mitochondrial defects or mitochondrial toxicity typically develop neurotoxicity, hypotonia, respiratory distress, and cardiac failure. beta-Alanine is a biomarker for the consumption of meat, especially red meat.",HMDB0000056_nmroned_1058_28054.txt,nmroned,beta-alanine 3-aminopropanoic acid 3-aminopropionic acid bala beta-aminopropionic acid h-beta-ala-oh omega-aminopropionic acid 3-aminopropanoate abufene 3-aminopropionate b-aminopropionate b-aminopropionic acid beta-aminopropionate β-aminopropionate β-aminopropionic acid h-b-ala-oh h-β-ala-oh omega-aminopropionate b-alanine β-alanine 2-carboxyethylamine 3-amino-propanoate 3-amino-propanoic acid b-aminopropanoate b-aminopropanoic acid beta alanine beta-aminopropanoate beta-aminopropanoic acid 3 aminopropionic acid β-aminopropanoic acid omega-aminopropanoic acid ω-aminopropanoic acid ω-aminopropionic acid beta-alanine

In humans and other mammals it is a second messenger and a key intracellular regulator, functioning as a mediator of activity for a number of hormones, including epinephrine, glucagon and ACTH. cAMP is synthesized from ATP by adenylate cyclase. Adenylate cyclase is located at the inner side of cell membranes. Adenylate cyclase is activated by the hormones glucagon and adrenaline and by G protein. Liver adenylate cyclase responds more strongly to glucagon, and muscle adenylate cyclase responds more strongly to adrenaline. cAMP decomposition into AMP is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphodiesterase. cAMP is primarily used for intracellular signal transduction, such as transferring into cells the effects of hormones like glucagon and adrenaline, which cannot pass through the plasma membrane. cAMP is also involved in the activation of protein kinases. In addition, cAMP binds to and regulates the function of ion channels such as the HCN channels. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide‚Äìgated (HCN) channels are integral membrane proteins that serve as nonselective voltage-gated cation channels in the plasma membranes of heart and brain cells.

It is then partially converted into acetone by decarboxylation and excreted either in urine or through respiration. Persistent mild hyperketonemia is a common finding in newborns. Ketone bodies serve as an indispensable source of energy for extrahepatic tissues, especially the brain and lung of developing rats. Another important function of ketone bodies is to provide acetoacetyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA for synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids, and complex lipids. During the early postnatal period, acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate are preferred over glucose as substrates for synthesis of phospholipids and sphingolipids in accord with requirements for brain growth and myelination. Thus, during the first two weeks of postnatal development, when the accumulation of cholesterol and phospholipids accelerates, the proportion of ketone bodies incorporated into these lipids increases. On the other hand, an increased proportion of ketone bodies are utilized for cerebroside synthesis during the period of active myelination. In the lung, AcAc serves better than glucose as a precursor for the synthesis of lung phospholipids. The synthesized lipids, particularly dipalmityl phosphatidylcholine, are incorporated into surfactant, and thus have a potential role in supplying adequate surfactant lipids to maintain lung function during the early days of life (PMID: 3884391).

It belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alpha amino acids and derivatives. These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon), or a derivative thereof. Creatine is found in all vertebrates where it facilitates recycling of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Its primary metabolic role is to combine with a phosphoryl group, via the enzyme creatine kinase, to generate phosphocreatine, which is used to regenerate ATP. Most of the human body's total creatine and phosphocreatine stores are found in skeletal muscle (95%), while the remainder is distributed in the blood, brain, testes, and other tissues. Creatine is not an essential nutrient as it is naturally produced in the human body from the amino acids glycine and arginine, with an additional requirement for methionine to catalyze the transformation of guanidinoacetate to creatine. In the first step of its biosynthesis glycine and arginine are combined by the enzyme arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) to form guanidinoacetate, which is then methylated by guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase (GAMT), using S-adenosyl methionine as the methyl donor. Creatine can also be obtained through the diet at a rate of about 1 gram per day from an omnivorous diet. A cyclic form of creatine, called creatinine, exists in equilibrium with its tautomer and with creatine. Clinically, there are three distinct disorders of creatine metabolism. Deficiencies in the two synthesis enzymes (AGAT and GAMT) can cause L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency (caused by variants in AGAT) and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency (caused by variants in GAMT). Both disorders are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. A third defect, creatine transporter defect, is caused by mutations in SLC6A8 and inherited in a X-linked manner.

Dopamine is synthesized in the body (mainly by nervous tissue and adrenal glands) first by the hydration of the amino acid tyrosine to DOPA by tyrosine hydroxylase and then by the decarboxylation of DOPA by aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase. Dopamine is a major transmitter in the extrapyramidal system of the brain, and important in regulating movement. A family of receptors (dopamine receptors) mediates its action, which plays a major role in reward-motivated behaviour. Dopamine has many other functions outside the brain. In blood vessels, dopamine inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator (at normal concentrations); in the kidneys, it increases sodium excretion and urine output; in the pancreas, it reduces insulin production; in the digestive system, it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa; and in the immune system, it reduces the activity of lymphocytes. Parkinson's disease, a degenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment, is caused by a loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in an area of the midbrain called the substantia nigra. There is evidence that schizophrenia involves altered levels of dopamine activity, and most antipsychotic drugs used to treat this are dopamine antagonists, which reduce dopamine activity. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and addiction are also characterized by defects in dopamine production or metabolism. It has been suggested that animals derived their dopamine-synthesizing machinery from bacteria via horizontal gene transfer that may have occurred relatively late in evolutionary time. This is perhaps a result of the symbiotic incorporation of bacteria into eukaryotic cells that gave rise to mitochondria. Dopamine is elevated in the urine of people who consume bananas. When present in sufficiently high levels, dopamine can be a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that disrupts or attacks neural tissue. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of dopamine are associated with neuroblastoma, Costello syndrome, leukemia, phaeochromocytoma, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency, and Menkes disease (MNK). High levels of dopamine can lead to hyperactivity, insomnia, agitation and anxiety, depression, delusions, excessive salivation, nausea, and digestive problems.

Pyrimidones are compounds that contain a pyrimidine ring, which bears a ketone. Pyrimidine is a 6-membered ring consisting of four carbon atoms and two nitrogen centers at the 1- and 3- ring positions. Dihydrouracil is an intermediate breakdown product of uracil. Dihydrouracil exists in all living organisms, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Within humans, dihydrouracil participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, dihydrouracil can be biosynthesized from uracil; which is mediated by the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase [NADP(+)]. The breakdown of uracil is a multistep reaction that leads to the production of beta-alanine. The reaction process begins with the enzyme known as dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DHP), which catalyzes the reduction of uracil into dihydrouracil. Then the enzyme known as dihydropyrimidinase hydrolyzes dihydrouracil into N-carbamyl-beta-alanine. Finally, beta-ureidopropionase catalyzes the conversion of N-carbamyl-beta-alanine into beta-alanine. There is at least one metabolic disorder that is associated with altered levels of dihydrouracil. In particular, dihydropyrimidinase deficiency is an inborn metabolic disorder that leads to highly increased concentrations of dihydrouracil and 5,6-dihydrothymine, and moderately increased concentrations of uracil and thymine in urine. Dihydropyrimidinase deficiency can cause neurological and gastrointestinal problems in some affected individuals (OMIM: 222748). In particular, patients with dihydropyrimidinase deficiency exhibit a number of neurological abnormalities including intellectual disability, seizures, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), an abnormally small head size (microcephaly), and autistic behaviours that affect communication and social interaction.

The most common neurological abnormalities that occur are intellectual disability, seizures, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), abnormally small head size (microcephaly), and autistic behaviours that affect communication and social interaction. Gastrointestinal problems that occur in dihydropyrimidinase deficiency include the backflow of acidic stomach contents into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux) and recurrent episodes of vomiting.",HMDB0000079_nmroned_5271_2734780.txt,nmroned,"dihydrothymine (-)-(s)-5,6-dihydrothymine (5s)-5-methyl-1,3-diazinane-2,4-dione 5,6-dihydro-5-methyluracil 5,6-dihydrothymine 5-methyl-5,6-dihydrouracil 5-methyldihydropyrimidine-2,4(1h,3h)-dione dihydro-5-methyl-2,4(1h,3h)-pyrimidinedione dihydrothymine"

Purine 2'-deoxyribonucleosides are compounds consisting of a purine linked to a ribose which lacks a hydroxyl group at position 2‚Äô. Deoxyguanosine is a nucleoside consisting of the base guanine and the sugar deoxyribose. Deoxyguanosine is one of the four deoxyribonucleosides that make up DNA. Deoxyguanosine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Deoxyguanosine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, deoxyguanosine can be biosynthesized from 2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-monophosphate through the enzyme known as cytosolic purine 5'-nucleotidase. In addition, deoxyguanosine can be converted into 2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-monophosphate (dGMP); which is mediated by the enzyme deoxyguanosine kinase. Deoxyguanosine is involved in the rare, inherited metabolic disorder called the purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency (PNP deficiency). In particular PNP deficiency is characterized by elevated levels of dGTP (deoxyguanosine triphosphate). PNP accounts for approximately 4% of patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (PMID: 1931007). PNP-deficient patients suffer from recurrent infections, usually beginning in the first year of life. Two thirds of patients have evidence of neurologic disorders with spasticity, developmental delay and mental retardation. Deoxyguanosine can be converted to 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) due to hydroxyl radical attack at the C8 of guanine. 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine is a sensitive marker of the DNA damage This damage, if left unrepaired, has been proposed to contribute to mutagenicity and cancer promotion.",HMDB0000085_nmroned_1075_28123.txt,nmroned,deoxyguanosine 2-amino-9-(2-deoxy-9-beta-d-ribofuranosyl)-9h-purin-6-ol 9-(2-deoxy-beta-d-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-guanine dg guanine deoxy nucleoside 2'-deoxyguanosine 2-amino-9-(2-deoxy-9-b-d-ribofuranosyl)-9h-purin-6-ol 2-amino-9-(2-deoxy-9-β-d-ribofuranosyl)-9h-purin-6-ol 9-(2-deoxy-b-d-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-guanine 9-(2-deoxy-β-d-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-guanine 2'-deoxy-guanosine 2-deoxyguanosine 9-(2-deoxy-b-d-erythro-pentofuranosyl)guanine 9-(2-deoxy-beta-delta-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-guanine 9-(2-deoxy-beta-delta-erythro-pentofuranosyl)guanine desoxyguanosine guanine deoxyriboside deoxyguanosine

These variations probably reflect the species differences in cytidine deaminase, the enzyme that converts cytidine to uridine in the body. The transport of cytidine into the brain's extracellular fluid, and then into neurons and glia, are essential prerequisites for cytidine to be utilized in the brain. An efficient mechanism mediating the brain uptake of circulating cytidine has not yet been demonstrated.

Citrate is an intermediate in the TCA cycle (also known as the Tricarboxylic Acid cycle, the Citric Acid cycle or Krebs cycle). The TCA cycle is a central metabolic pathway for all animals, plants, and bacteria. As a result, citrate is found in all living organisms, from bacteria to plants to animals. In the TCA cycle, the enzyme citrate synthase catalyzes the condensation of oxaloacetate with acetyl CoA to form citrate. Citrate then acts as the substrate for the enzyme known as aconitase and is then converted into aconitic acid. The TCA cycle ends with regeneration of oxaloacetate. This series of chemical reactions in the TCA cycle is the source of two-thirds of the food-derived energy in higher organisms. Citrate can be transported out of the mitochondria and into the cytoplasm, then broken down into acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis, and into oxaloacetate. Citrate is a positive modulator of this conversion, and allosterically regulates the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which is the regulating enzyme in the conversion of acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA (the commitment step in fatty acid synthesis). In short, citrate is transported into the cytoplasm, converted into acetyl CoA, which is then converted into malonyl CoA by acetyl CoA carboxylase, which is allosterically modulated by citrate. In mammals and other vertebrates, Citrate is a vital component of bone, helping to regulate the size of apatite crystals (PMID: 21127269). Citric acid is found in citrus fruits, most concentrated in lemons and limes, where it can comprise as much as 8% of the dry weight of the fruit. Citric acid is a natural preservative and is also used to add an acidic (sour) taste to foods and carbonated drinks. Because it is one of the stronger edible acids, the dominant use of citric acid is as a flavoring and preservative in food and beverages, especially soft drinks and candies. Citric acid is an excellent chelating agent, binding metals by making them soluble. It is used to remove and discourage the buildup of limescale from boilers and evaporators. It can be used to treat water, which makes it useful in improving the effectiveness of soaps and laundry detergents.

Choline can be oxidized to form betaine, which is a methyl source for many reactions (i.e. conversion of homocysteine into methionine). Lack of sufficient amounts of choline in the diet can lead to a fatty liver condition and general liver damage.

It is composed of adenine attached to a deoxyribose moiety via a N9-glycosidic bond. Deoxyribose differs from ribose by the absence of oxygen in the 3' position of its ribose ring. Deoxyadenosine is a critical component of DNA. When present in sufficiently high levels, deoxyadensoine can act as an immunotoxin and a metabotoxin. An immunotoxin disrupts, limits the function, or destroys immune cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenous metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of deoxyadenosine are associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, an inborn error of metabolism. ADA deficiency damages the immune system and causes severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). People with SCID lack virtually all immune protection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi. They are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be very serious or life-threatening. These infections are often caused by ""opportunistic"" organisms that ordinarily do not cause illness in people with a normal immune system. The main symptoms of ADA deficiency are pneumonia, chronic diarrhea, and widespread skin rashes. The mechanism by which dATP functions as an immunotoxin is as follows: because deoxyadenosine is a precursor to dATP, a buildup of dATP in cells inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and prevents DNA synthesis, so cells are unable to divide. Since developing T cells and B cells are some of the most mitotically active cells, they are unable to divide and propagate to respond to immune challenges.

It is produced from galactose in a reaction catalyzed by aldose reductase. When present in sufficiently high levels, galactitol can act as a metabotoxin, a neurotoxin, and a hepatotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that disrupts or attacks neural cells and neural tissue. A hepatotoxin as a compound that disrupts or attacks liver tissue or liver cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of galactitol are associated with at least two inborn errors of metabolism, including galactosemia and galactosemia type II. Galactosemia is a rare genetic metabolic disorder that affects an individual's ability to metabolize the sugar galactose properly. Excess lactose consumption in individuals with galactose intolerance or galactosemia activates aldose reductase to produce galactitol, thus depleting NADPH and leading to lowered glutathione reductase activity. As a result, hydrogen peroxide or other free radicals accumulate causing serious oxidative damage to various cells and tissues. In individuals with galactosemia, the enzymes needed for the further metabolism of galactose (galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase) are severely diminished or missing entirely, leading to toxic levels of galactose 1-phosphate, galactitol, and galactonate.

It has bactericidal activity and is used often as a topical disinfectant. It is widely used as a solvent and preservative in pharmaceutical preparations as well as serving as the primary ingredient in alcoholic beverages. Indeed, ethanol has widespread use as a solvent of substances intended for human contact or consumption, including scents, flavorings, colorings, and medicines. Ethanol has a depressive effect on the central nervous system and because of its psychoactive effects, it is considered a drug. Ethanol has a complex mode of action and affects multiple systems in the brain, most notably it acts as an agonist to the GABA receptors. Death from ethanol consumption is possible when blood alcohol level reaches 0.4%. A blood level of 0.5% or more is commonly fatal. Levels of even less than 0.1% can cause intoxication, with unconsciousness often occurring at 0.3-0.4 %. Ethanol is metabolized by the body as an energy-providing carbohydrate nutrient, as it metabolizes into acetyl CoA, an intermediate common with glucose metabolism, that can be used for energy in the citric acid cycle or for biosynthesis. Ethanol within the human body is converted into acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and then into acetic acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. The product of the first step of this breakdown, acetaldehyde, is more toxic than ethanol. Acetaldehyde is linked to most of the clinical effects of alcohol. It has been shown to increase the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver,[77] multiple forms of cancer, and alcoholism. Industrially, ethanol is produced both as a petrochemical, through the hydration of ethylene, and biologically, by fermenting sugars with yeast. Small amounts of ethanol are endogenously produced by gut microflora through anaerobic fermentation. However most ethanol detected in biofluids and tissues likely comes from consumption of alcoholic beverages. Absolute ethanol or anhydrous alcohol generally refers to purified ethanol, containing no more than one percent water. Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption. It often contains trace amounts of toxic benzene (used to remove water by azeotropic distillation). Consumption of this form of ethanol can be fatal over a short time period. Generally absolute or pure ethanol is used as a solvent for lab and industrial settings where water will disrupt a desired reaction. Pure ethanol is classed as 200 proof in the USA and Canada, equivalent to 175 degrees proof in the UK system. Ethanol is a general biomarker for the consumption of alcohol.

It is the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system. In vertebrates, GABA acts at inhibitory synapses in the brain. It acts by binding to specific transmembrane receptors in the plasma membrane of both pre- and postsynaptic neurons. This binding causes the opening of ion channels to allow either the flow of negatively-charged chloride ions into the cell or positively-charged potassium ions out of the cell. This will typically result in a negative change in the transmembrane potential, usually causing hyperpolarization. Three general classes of GABA receptor are known (PMID: 10561820). These include GABA-A and GABA-C ionotropic receptors, which are ion channels themselves, and GABA-B metabotropic receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors that open ion channels via intermediaries known as G proteins (PMID: 10561820). Activation of the GABA-B receptor by GABA causes neuronal membrane hyperpolarization and a resultant inhibition of neurotransmitter release. In addition to binding sites for GABA, the GABA-A receptor has binding sites for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and neurosteroids. GABA-A receptors are coupled to chloride ion channels. Therefore, activation of the GABA-A receptor induces increased inward chloride ion flux, resulting in membrane hyperpolarization and neuronal inhibition (PMID: 10561820). After release into the synapse, free GABA that does not bind to either the GABA-A or GABA-B receptor complexes can be taken up by neurons and glial cells. Four different GABA membrane transporter proteins (GAT-1, GAT-2, GAT-3, and BGT-1), which differ in their distribution in the CNS, are believed to mediate the uptake of synaptic GABA into neurons and glial cells. The GABA-A receptor subtype regulates neuronal excitability and rapid changes in fear arousal, such as anxiety, panic, and the acute stress response (PMID: 10561820). Drugs that stimulate GABA-A receptors, such as the benzodiazepines and barbiturates, have anxiolytic and anti-seizure effects via GABA-A-mediated reduction of neuronal excitability, which effectively raises the seizure threshold. GABA-A antagonists produce convulsions in animals and there is decreased GABA-A receptor binding in a positron emission tomography (PET) study of patients with panic disorder. Neurons that produce GABA as their output are called GABAergic neurons and have chiefly inhibitory action at receptors in the vertebrate. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) are a typical example of inhibitory CNS GABAergic cells. GABA has been shown to have excitatory roles in the vertebrate, most notably in the developing cortex. Organisms synthesize GABA from glutamate using the enzyme L-glutamic acid decarboxylase and pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor (PMID: 12467378). It is worth noting that this involves converting the principal excitatory neurotransmitter (glutamate) into the principal inhibitory one (GABA). Drugs that act as agonists of GABA receptors (known as GABA analogs or GABAergic drugs), or increase the available amount of GABA typically have relaxing, anti-anxiety, and anti-convulsive effects. GABA is found to be deficient in cerebrospinal fluid and the brain in many studies of experimental and human epilepsy. Benzodiazepines (such as Valium) are useful in status epilepticus because they act on GABA receptors. GABA increases in the brain after administration of many seizure medications. Hence, GABA is clearly an antiepileptic nutrient. Inhibitors of GAM metabolism can also produce convulsions. Spasticity and involuntary movement syndromes, such as Parkinson's, Friedreich's ataxia, tardive dyskinesia, and Huntington's chorea, are all marked by low GABA when amino acid levels are studied. Trials of 2 to 3 g of GABA given orally have been effective in various epilepsy and spasticity syndromes. Agents that elevate GABA are also useful in lowering hypertension. Three grams orally have been effective in controlling blood pressure. GABA is decreased in various encephalopathies. GABA can reduce appetite and is decreased in hypoglycemics. GABA reduces blood sugar in diabetics. Chronic brain syndromes can also be marked by deficiencies of GABA. Vitamin B6, manganese, taurine, and lysine can increase both GABA synthesis and effects, while aspartic acid and glutamic acid probably inhibit GABA effects. Low plasma GABA has been reported in some depressed patients and may be a useful trait marker for mood disorders. GABA has an important role in embryonic development, especially facial development, as substantiated by the association of a cleft palate in transgenic mice deficient in GAD67 (glutamate decarboxylase). A recent Japanese population study reported linkage in patients with a nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without a cleft palate and specific GAD67 haplotypes (PMID: 23842532). Unusually high levels of GABA (especially in the brain) can be toxic and GABA can function as both a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that damages the brain and/or nerve tissue. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of GABA are associated with at least five inborn errors of metabolism, including D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, 4-hydroxybutyric aciduria/succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, GABA-transaminase deficiency, homocarnosinosis, and hyper beta-alaninemia. Nearly all of these conditions are associated with seizures, hypotonia, intellectual deficits, macrocephaly, encephalopathy, and other serious neurological or neuromuscular problems. Increased levels of GABA seem to alter the function of the GABA-B receptor, which may play a role in the tonic-clonic seizures that are often seen in patients with the above disorders. GABA is also a microbial metabolite, urinary GABA is produced by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium (PMID: 24621061).",HMDB0000112_nmroned_1088_28180.txt,nmroned,"gamma-aminobutyric acid 4-aminobutanoic acid 4-aminobutyric acid 4abu gaba gamma-amino-butanoic acid gamma-amino-n-butyric acid gamma-aminobutanoic acid gamma-aminobuttersaeure omega-aminobutyric acid piperidic acid piperidinic acid 4-aminobutyrate gammalon 4-aminobutanoate g-amino-butanoate g-amino-butanoic acid gamma-amino-butanoate γ-amino-butanoate γ-amino-butanoic acid g-amino-n-butyrate g-amino-n-butyric acid gamma-amino-n-butyrate γ-amino-n-butyrate γ-amino-n-butyric acid g-aminobutanoate g-aminobutanoic acid gamma-aminobutanoate γ-aminobutanoate γ-aminobutanoic acid g-aminobuttersaeure γ-aminobuttersaeure omega-aminobutyrate piperidate piperidinate g-aminobutyrate g-aminobutyric acid gamma-aminobutyrate γ-aminobutyrate γ-aminobutyric acid 3-carboxypropylamine aminalon gaballon gamarex gamma aminobutyrate gamma aminobutyric acid gammalone gammar gammasol mielogen mielomade w-aminobutyrate w-aminobutyric acid gamma-aminobutyric acid, calcium salt (2:1) gamma-aminobutyric acid, hydrochloride gamma-aminobutyric acid, zinc salt (2:1) 4 aminobutanoic acid 4 aminobutyric acid lithium gaba gamma aminobutyric acid, monolithium salt gamma aminobutyric acid, monosodium salt gamma-aminobutyric acid, monolithium salt gamma-aminobutyric acid, monosodium salt acid, hydrochloride gamma-aminobutyric aminalone gaba, lithium hydrochloride gamma-aminobutyric acid gamma aminobutyric acid, hydrochloride 4-amino-butanoate gamma-aminobutyric acid"

This colourless, odourless, and hygroscopic crystalline solid is highly soluble in water. Due to its excellent capability to penetrate skin, glycolic acid is often used in skin care products, most often as a chemical peel. It may reduce wrinkles, acne scarring, and hyperpigmentation and improve many other skin conditions, including actinic keratosis, hyperkeratosis, and seborrheic keratosis. Once applied, glycolic acid reacts with the upper layer of the epidermis, weakening the binding properties of the lipids that hold the dead skin cells together. This allows the outer skin to dissolve, revealing the underlying skin. It is thought that this is due to the reduction of calcium ion concentrations in the epidermis and the removal of calcium ions from cell adhesions, leading to desquamation. Glycolic acid is a known inhibitor of tyrosinase. This can suppress melanin formation and lead to a lightening of skin colour. Acute doses of glycolic acid on skin or eyes leads to local effects that are typical of a strong acid (e.g. dermal and eye irritation). Glycolate is a nephrotoxin if consumed orally. A nephrotoxin is a compound that causes damage to the kidney and kidney tissues. Glycolic acid's renal toxicity is due to its metabolism to oxalic acid. Glycolic and oxalic acid, along with excess lactic acid, are responsible for the anion gap metabolic acidosis. Oxalic acid readily precipitates with calcium to form insoluble calcium oxalate crystals. Renal tissue injury is caused by widespread deposition of oxalate crystals and the toxic effects of glycolic acid. Glycolic acid does exhibit some inhalation toxicity and can cause respiratory, thymus, and liver damage if present in very high levels over long periods of time. Elevated glycolic acid without elevated oxalic acid is most likely a result of GI yeast overgrowth (Aspergillus, Penicillium, probably Candida) or due to dietary sources containing glycerol (glycerine).

Methoxyphenols are compounds containing a methoxy group attached to the benzene ring of a phenol moiety. HVA is also classified as a catechol.  HVA is a major catecholamine metabolite that is produced by a consecutive action of monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyltransferase on dopamine. HVA is typically elevated in patients with catecholamine-secreting tumors (such as neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and other neural crest tumors). HVA levels are also used in monitoring patients who have been treated for these kinds tumors. HVA levels may also be altered in disorders of catecholamine metabolism such as monoamine oxidase-A (MOA) deficiency. MOA deficiency can cause decreased urinary HVA values, while a deficiency of dopamine beta-hydrolase (the enzyme that converts dopamine to norepinephrine) can cause elevated urinary HVA values. Within humans, HVA participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, HVA and pyrocatechol can be biosynthesized from 3,4-dihydroxybenzeneacetic acid and guaiacol. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme known as catechol O-methyltransferase. In addition, HVA can be biosynthesized from homovanillin through the action of the enzyme known aldehyde dehydrogenase. HVA has recently been found in a number of beers and appears to arise from the fermentation process (https://doi.org/10.1006/fstl.1999.0593). HVA is also a metabolite of Bifidobacterium (PMID: 24958563) and the bacterial breakdown of dietary flavonoids. Dietary flavonols commonly found in tomatoes, onions, and tea, can lead to significantly elevated levels of urinary HVA (PMID: 20933512). Likewise, the microbial digestion of hydroxytyrosol (found in olive oil) can also lead to elevated levels of HVA in humans (PMID: 11929304).",HMDB0000118_nmroned_1090_28189.txt,nmroned,"homovanillic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzeneacetic acid hva vanillacetic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acetate 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzeneacetate vanillacetate homovanillate 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylacetic acid 4-hydroxy 3-methoxyphenylacetic acid 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid homovanilate homovanilic acid homovanillinic acid vanilacetate vanilacetic acid 3 methoxy 4 hydroxyphenylacetic acid acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic 4 hydroxy 3 methoxyphenylacetic acid acid, homovanillic 3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxyphenylacetic acid 3’-methoxy-4’-hydroxyphenylacetic acid 4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxy-phenylacetic acid 2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid 4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenylacetic acid"

Glyoxylic acid is a liquid with a melting point of -93°C and a boiling point of 111°C. It is an intermediate of the glyoxylate cycle, which enables certain organisms to convert fatty acids into carbohydrates. The conjugate base of glyoxylic acid is known as glyoxylate (PMID: 16396466). In humans, glyoxylate is produced via two pathways: (1) through the oxidation of glycolate in peroxisomes and (2) through the catabolism of hydroxyproline in mitochondria. In the peroxisomes, glyoxylate is converted into glycine by glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT1) or into oxalate by glycolate oxidase. In the mitochondria, glyoxylate is converted into glycine by mitochondrial glyoxylate aminotransferase AGT2 or into glycolate by glycolate reductase. A small amount of glyoxylate is converted into oxalate by cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase. Glyoxylic acid is found to be associated with primary hyperoxaluria I, which is an inborn error of metabolism. Under certain circumstances, glyoxylate can be a nephrotoxin and a metabotoxin. A nephrotoxin is a compound that causes damage to the kidney and kidney tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. High levels of glyoxylate are involved in the development of hyperoxaluria, a key cause of nephrolithiasis (commonly known as kidney stones). Glyoxylate is both a substrate and inductor of sulfate anion transporter-1 (SAT-1), a gene responsible for oxalate transportation, allowing it to increase SAT-1 mRNA expression, and as a result oxalate efflux from the cell. The increased oxalate release allows the buildup of calcium oxalate in the urine, and thus the eventual formation of kidney stones. As an aldehyde, glyoxylate is also highly reactive and will modify proteins to form advanced glycation products (AGEs).",HMDB0000119_nmroned_1091_28194.txt,nmroned,"glyoxylic acid alpha-ketoacetic acid formylformic acid glyoxalate glyoxalsaeure glyoxylate glyoxylsaeure oxalaldehydic acid oxoethanoic acid a-ketoacetate a-ketoacetic acid alpha-ketoacetate α-ketoacetate α-ketoacetic acid formylformate glyoxalic acid oxalaldehydate oxoethanoate oxoacetate oxoacetic acid glyoxylic acid, 2-(14)c-labeled glyoxylic acid, sodium salt glyoxylic acid, sodium salt, 2-(14)c-labeled glyoxylic acid, 14c2-labeled glyoxylic acid, calcium salt glyoxylic acid, sodium salt, 14c-labeled"

Chemically, folate consists of three distinct chemical moieties linked together. A pterin (2-amino-4-hydroxy-pteridine) linked by a methylene bridge to a p-aminobenzoyl group that in turn is linked through an amide linkage to glutamic acid. It is a member of the vitamin B family and is primarily known as vitamin B9. Folate is required for the body to make DNA and RNA and metabolize amino acids necessary for cell division for the hematopoietic system. As humans cannot make folate, it is required in the diet, making it an essential nutrient (i.e. a vitamin). Folate occurs naturally in many foods including mushrooms, spinach, yeast, green leaves, and grasses (poaceae). Folic acid, being biochemically inactive, is converted to tetrahydrofolic acid and methyltetrahydrofolate by the enzyme known as dihydrofolate reductase. Tetrahydrofolate and methyltetrahydrofolate are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids and generate formic acid. Folic acid is used in the treatment and prevention of folate deficiencies and megaloblastic anemia. Folic acid is also used as a supplement by women during pregnancy to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) in babies. Low levels in early pregnancy are believed to be the cause of more than half of babies born with NTDs (PMID: 28097362).

It is referred to as an aldohexose. The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) and ring (cyclic) form, the latter being the result of an intramolecular reaction between the aldehyde C atom and the C-5 hydroxyl group to form an intramolecular hemiacetal. In aqueous solution, both forms are in equilibrium and at pH 7 the cyclic one is predominant. Glucose is a primary source of energy for all living organisms. It is a fundamental metabolite found in all organisms, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Most of the world‚Äôs glucose is made by plants and algae during photosynthesis from water and carbon dioxide, where it is used to make cellulose (and other polymeric forms of glucose called polysaccharides) that stabilize plant cell walls. Glucose is also found in fruits and other parts of plants in its free state. In animals, glucose can be generated from the breakdown of glycogen in a process known as glycogenolysis. Glucose can also be synthesized de novo in animals. In particular it can be synthesized in the liver and kidneys from non-carbohydrate intermediates, such as pyruvate and glycerol, by a process known as gluconeogenesis. Humans also consume large amounts of glucose as part of their regular diet. Ingested glucose initially binds to the receptor for sweet taste on the tongue in humans. This complex of the proteins T1R2 and T1R3 makes it possible to identify glucose-containing food sources. Glucose in the body mainly comes from food - about 300 g per day for the average adult. In humans, the breakdown of glucose-containing polysaccharides happens partly during chewing by means of the enzyme known as amylase, which is contained in saliva, as well as by other enzymes such as maltase, lactase and sucrase on the brush border of the small intestine. The blood sugar content of a healthy person in the short-time fasting state, e.g. after overnight fasting, is about 70 to 100 mg/dL of blood (4 to 5.5 mM). In blood plasma, the measured values are about 10‚Äì15% higher.  Dysregulated metabolism of glucose can lead to a number of diseases including diabetes. Diabetes is a metabolic disorder where the body is unable to regulate levels of glucose in the blood either because of a lack of insulin in the body or the failure, by cells in the body, to respond properly to insulin. Each of these situations can be caused by persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, through pancreatic burnout and insulin resistance.",HMDB0000122_nmroned_5259_2734637.txt,nmroned,"d-glucose glucose b-d-glucose β-d-glucose b-d-glucopyranose b-dextrose b-glucose beta-d-glucopyranose beta-dextrose beta-glucose d glucose glucose, (beta-d)-isomer dextrose glucose, (dl)-isomer d-glucose d-glucopyranose d-glucopyranoside beta-d-glucopyranoside beta-d-glucose β-d-glucopyranose β-d-glucopyranoside β-d-glucose β-dextrose β-glucose d-glc d-glcp glc-oh"

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. Glycine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Glycine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as an aliphatic, non-polar amino acid and is the simplest of all amino acids. In humans, glycine is a nonessential amino acid, although experimental animals show reduced growth on low-glycine diets. The average adult human ingests 3 to 5 grams of glycine daily. Glycine is a colorless, sweet-tasting crystalline solid. It is the only achiral proteinogenic amino acid. Glycine was discovered in 1820 by the French chemist Henri Braconnot when he hydrolyzed gelatin by boiling it with sulfuric acid. The name comes from the Greek word glucus or ""sweet tasting"". Glycine is biosynthesized in the body from the amino acid serine, which is in turn derived from 3-phosphoglycerate. In the liver of vertebrates, glycine synthesis is catalyzed by glycine synthase (also called glycine cleavage enzyme). In addition to being synthesized from serine, glycine can also be derived from threonine, choline or hydroxyproline via inter-organ metabolism of the liver and kidneys. Glycine is degraded via three pathways. The predominant pathway in animals and plants is the reverse of the glycine synthase pathway. In this context, the enzyme system involved glycine metabolism is called the glycine cleavage system. The glycine cleavage system catalyzes the oxidative conversion of glycine into carbon dioxide and ammonia, with the remaining one-carbon unit transferred to folate as methylenetetrahydrofolate. It is the main catabolic pathway for glycine and it also contributes to one-carbon metabolism. Patients with a deficiency of this enzyme system have increased glycine in plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with an increased CSF:plasma glycine ratio (PMID: 16151895). Glycine levels are effectively measured in plasma in both normal patients and those with inborn errors of glycine metabolism (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/). Nonketotic hyperglycinaemia (OMIM: 606899) is an autosomal recessive condition caused by deficient enzyme activity of the glycine cleavage enzyme system (EC 2.1.1.10). The glycine cleavage enzyme system comprises four proteins: P-, T-, H- and L-proteins (EC 1.4.4.2, EC 2.1.2.10, and EC 1.8.1.4 for P-, T-, and L-proteins). Mutations have been described in the GLDC (OMIM: 238300), AMT (OMIM: 238310), and GCSH (OMIM: 238330) genes encoding the P-, T-, and H-proteins respectively. Glycine is involved in the body's production of DNA, hemoglobin, and collagen, and in the release of energy. The principal function of glycine is as a precursor to proteins. Most proteins incorporate only small quantities of glycine, a notable exception being collagen, which contains about 35% glycine. In higher eukaryotes, delta-aminolevulinic acid, the key precursor to porphyrins (needed for hemoglobin and cytochromes), is biosynthesized from glycine and succinyl-CoA by the enzyme ALA synthase. Glycine provides the central C2N subunit of all purines, which are key constituents of DNA and RNA. Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, especially in the spinal cord, brainstem, and retina. When glycine receptors are activated, chloride enters the neuron via ionotropic receptors, causing an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP).",HMDB0000123_nmroned_1094_28208.txt,nmroned,"glycine aminoacetic acid aminoessigsaeure aminoethanoic acid g gly glycin glycocoll glykokoll glyzin h2n-ch2-cooh hgly leimzucker aminoacetate aminoethanoate 2-aminoacetate 2-aminoacetic acid aciport amino-acetate amino-acetic acid glicoamin glycolixir glycosthene gyn-hydralin padil glycine carbonate (1:1), monosodium salt glycine carbonate (2:1), monopotassium salt glycine sulfate (3:1) glycine, monoammonium salt glycine, monosodium salt glycine, sodium hydrogen carbonate monoammonium salt glycine calcium salt glycine glycine hydrochloride (2:1) glycine phosphate (1:1) glycine, monopotasssium salt monopotasssium salt glycine monosodium salt glycine glycine carbonate (2:1), monolithium salt glycine carbonate (2:1), monosodium salt glycine hydrochloride glycine, copper salt hydrochloride, glycine salt glycine, monoammonium acid, aminoacetic cobalt salt glycine copper salt glycine glycine phosphate glycine, calcium salt glycine, calcium salt (2:1) glycine, cobalt salt phosphate, glycine salt glycine, monosodium"

Like cysteine, glutathione contains the crucial thiol (-SH) group that makes it an effective antioxidant. There are virtually no living organisms on this planet-animal or plant whose cells don't contain some glutathione. Scientists have speculated that glutathione was essential to the very development of life on earth. glutathione has many roles; in none does it act alone. It is a coenzyme in various enzymatic reactions. The most important of these are redox reactions, in which the thiol grouping on the cysteine portion of cell membranes protects against peroxidation; and conjugation reactions, in which glutathione (especially in the liver) binds with toxic chemicals in order to detoxify them. glutathione is also important in red and white blood cell formation and throughout the immune system. glutathione's clinical uses include the prevention of oxygen toxicity in hyperbaric oxygen therapy, treatment of lead and other heavy metal poisoning, lowering of the toxicity of chemotherapy and radiation in cancer treatments, and reversal of cataracts. (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/) glutathione participates in leukotriene synthesis and is a cofactor for the enzyme glutathione peroxidase. It is also important as a hydrophilic molecule that is added to lipophilic toxins and waste in the liver during biotransformation before they can become part of the bile. glutathione is also needed for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, a toxin produced as a by-product of metabolism. This detoxification reaction is carried out by the glyoxalase system. Glyoxalase I (EC 4.4.1.5) catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal and reduced glutathione to S-D-Lactoyl-glutathione. Glyoxalase II (EC 3.1.2.6) catalyzes the hydrolysis of S-D-Lactoyl-glutathione to glutathione and D-lactate. GSH is known as a substrate in both conjugation reactions and reduction reactions, catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase enzymes in cytosol, microsomes, and mitochondria. However, it is also capable of participating in non-enzymatic conjugation with some chemicals, as in the case of n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), the reactive cytochrome P450-reactive metabolite formed by acetaminophen, that becomes toxic when GSH is depleted by an overdose (of acetaminophen). glutathione in this capacity binds to NAPQI as a suicide substrate and in the process detoxifies it, taking the place of cellular protein thiol groups which would otherwise be covalently modified; when all GSH has been spent, NAPQI begins to react with the cellular proteins, killing the cells in the process. The preferred treatment for an overdose of this painkiller is the administration (usually in atomized form) of N-acetylcysteine, which is used by cells to replace spent GSSG and renew the usable GSH pool.

Guanidinoacetic acid was first prepared in 1861 by Adolph Strecker by reaction of cyanamide with glycine in aqueous solution. Manufactured guanidinoacetic acid is primarily used a feed additive approved by EFSA in poultry farming (for fattening), and pigs for fattening. Guanidoacetic acid exists naturally in all vertebrates. It is formed primarily in the kidneys by transferring the guanidine group of L-arginine to the amino acid glycine via the enzyme known as L-Arg:Gly-amidinotransferase (AGAT). In a further step, guanidinoacetate is methylated to generate creatine using S-adenosyl methionine (as the methyl donor) via the enzyme known as guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase (GAMT).

The resulting homogentisic acid is then broken down into 4-maleylacetoacetate via the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase. Homogentisic acid is also found in other organisms. For instance, it can found in Arbutus unedo (strawberry-tree) honey, in the bacterial plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris as well as in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica where it is associated with the production of brown pigments. Homogentisic acid can be oxidatively dimerized to form hipposudoric acid, one of the main constituents of the 'blood sweat' of hippopotamuses.

Homogentisic acid and its oxidized form benzoquinone acetic acid are excreted in the urine, giving it an unusually dark color. The accumulating homogentisic acid (and benzoquinone acetic acid) causes damage to cartilage (ochronosis, leading to osteoarthritis) and heart valves as well as precipitating as kidney stones and stones in other organs. More specifically, homogentisic acid can be converted to benzoquinone acetic acid (BQA), and the resulting BQA can be readily converted to polymers that resemble the dark skin pigment melanin. These polymers are deposited in the collagen, a connective tissue protein, of particular tissues such as cartilage. This process is called ochronosis (as the tissue looks ochre); ochronotic tissue is stiffened and unusually brittle, impairing its normal function and causing damage.

It is widely used in the food industry as a sweetener and humectant and in pharmaceutical formulations. Glycerol is an important component of triglycerides (i.e. fats and oils) and of phospholipids. Glycerol is a three-carbon substance that forms the backbone of fatty acids in fats. When the body uses stored fat as a source of energy, glycerol and fatty acids are released into the bloodstream. The glycerol component can be converted into glucose by the liver and provides energy for cellular metabolism. Normally, glycerol shows very little acute toxicity and very high oral doses or acute exposures can be tolerated. On the other hand, chronically high levels of glycerol in the blood are associated with glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD). GKD causes the condition known as hyperglycerolemia, an accumulation of glycerol in the blood and urine. There are three clinically distinct forms of GKD: infantile, juvenile, and adult. The infantile form is the most severe and is associated with vomiting, lethargy, severe developmental delay, and adrenal insufficiency. The mechanisms of glycerol toxicity in infants are not known, but it appears to shift metabolism towards chronic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated GKD. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development.

Guanine is a derivative of purine, consisting of a fused pyrimidine-imidazole ring system with conjugated double bonds. Being unsaturated, the bicyclic molecule is planar. The guanine nucleoside is called guanosine. The first isolation of guanine was reported in 1844 from the excreta of sea birds, known as guano, which was used as a source of fertilizer. High affinity binding of guanine nucleotides and the ability to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP are characteristics of an extended family of intracellular proteins. Guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins may be involved in the activation of phospholipases C and A2 by hormones and other ligands. The binding of hormones to receptors that activate phospholipase C is decreased by guanine nucleotides and these hormones also stimulate a high-affinity GTPase activity in cell membranes. Effects of hormones on phospholipase C activity in cell-free preparations are dependent on the presence of guanine nucleotides. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT, EC 2.4.2.8) is a purine salvage enzyme that catalyses the conversion of hypoxanthine and guanine to their respective mononucleotides. Partial deficiency of this enzyme can result in the overproduction of uric acid leading to a severe form of gout, whilst a virtual absence of HPRT activity causes the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, an inborn error of metabolism, which is characterised by hyperuricaemia, mental retardation, choreoathetosis and compulsive self-mutilation. Peroxynitrite induces DNA base damage predominantly at guanine (G) and 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) nucleobases via oxidation reactions. G and 8-oxoG are the most reactive bases toward Peroxynitrite and possibly the major contributors to peroxynitrite-derived genotoxic and mutagenic lesions. The neutral G radical, reacts with NO2 to yield 8-nitroguanine and 5-nitro-4-guanidinohydantoin (PMID: 16352449, 2435586, 2838362, 1487231).",HMDB0000132_nmroned_1102_28244.txt,nmroned,"guanine 2-amino-6-hydroxypurine 2-amino-6-oxopurine g gua 2-amino-1,7-dihydro-6h-purin-6-one 2-amino-1,9-dihydro-6h-purin-6-one 2-amino-1,9-dihydro-purin-6-one 2-amino-3,7-dihydro-6h-purin-6-one 2-amino-6-hydroxy-1h-purine 2-amino-6-purinol 2-amino-hypoxanthine 2-aminohypoxanthine 6-hydroxy-2-aminopurine c.i. natural white 1 ci natural white 1 dew pearl guanin guanine enol gun mearlmaid mearlmaid aa natural pearl essence natural white 1 naturon pathocidin pearl essence stella polaris"

Purine nucleosides are compounds comprising a purine base attached to a ribosyl or deoxyribosyl sugar moiety. Guanosine consists of a guanine base attached to a ribose (ribofuranose) ring via a beta-N9-glycosidic bond. Guanosine is a white, crystalline powder with no odor and mild saline taste. It is very soluble in acetic acid, and slightly soluble in water, but insoluble in ethanol, diethyl ether, benzene, and chloroform. Guanosine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. High levels of guanosine can be found in clovers, coffee plants, and the pollen of pines. It has been detected, but not quantified in, several different foods, such as leeks, garlic, chicory roots, green bell peppers, and black-eyed peas. Guanosine plays an important role in various biochemical processes including the synthesis of nucleic acids such as RNA and intracellular signal transduction (cGMP). The antiviral drug acyclovir, often used in herpes treatment, and the anti-HIV drug abacavir, are both structurally similar to guanosine. Guanosine can be phosphorylated to become guanosine monophosphate (GMP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), guanosine diphosphate (GDP), and guanosine triphosphate (GTP). In humans, guanosine is involved in intracellular signalling through the adenosine receptors A1R and A2AR (PMID: 31847113). Evidence from rodent and cell models has shown a number of important neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects of guanosine. In particular, it is effective in preventing deleterious consequences of seizures, spinal cord injury, pain, mood disorders and aging-related diseases, such as ischemia, Parkinson‚Äôs and Alzheimer‚Äôs diseases (PMID: 27699087). Studies with rodent models of Parkinson‚Äôs disease have shown that guanosine decreases neuronal apoptotic cell death and increases dopaminergic neurons at substantia nigra pars compacta, accompanied by an improvement of motor symptoms in Parkinson‚Äôs disease (i.e. a reduction of bradykinesia). Guanosine promotes neurite arborization, outgrowth, proliferation and differentiation. Systemic administration of guanosine for eight weeks (8 mg/kg) has been shown to stimulate neuroprogenitors proliferation in the subventricular zone (SVZ) in a mouse model of Parkinsonism (PMID: 27699087). The effect of guanosine treatment is accompanied by an increased number of fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2)-positive cells which is an important regulator of neuroprogenitor/stem cell proliferation, survival and differentiation (PMID: 27699087). Guanosine prevents reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cell death in hippocampal slices subjected to the oxygen/glucose deprivation (PMID: 31847113).",HMDB0000133_nmroned_1103_28248.txt,nmroned,"guanosine 2(3h)-imino-9-beta-d-ribofuranosyl-9h-purin-6(1h)-one 2-amino-1,9-dihydro-9-beta-d-ribofuranosyl-6h-purin-6-one 2-amino-9-beta-d-ribofuranosyl-1,9-dihydro-6h-purin-6-one 9-beta-d-ribofuranosyl-guanine g guanine riboside guanine-9-beta-d-ribofuranoside guanosin guo 2(3h)-imino-9-b-d-ribofuranosyl-9h-purin-6(1h)-one 2(3h)-imino-9-β-d-ribofuranosyl-9h-purin-6(1h)-one 2-amino-1,9-dihydro-9-b-d-ribofuranosyl-6h-purin-6-one 2-amino-1,9-dihydro-9-β-d-ribofuranosyl-6h-purin-6-one 2-amino-9-b-d-ribofuranosyl-1,9-dihydro-6h-purin-6-one 2-amino-9-β-d-ribofuranosyl-1,9-dihydro-6h-purin-6-one 9-b-d-ribofuranosyl-guanine 9-β-d-ribofuranosyl-guanine guanine-9-b-d-ribofuranoside guanine-9-β-d-ribofuranoside 2-amino-1,9-dihydro-9-beta-delta-ribofuranosyl-6h-purin-6-one 2-amino-inosine 9-beta-delta-ribofuranosyl-guanine b-d-ribofuranoside guanine-9 beta-delta-ribofuranoside guanine-9 ribonucleoside vernine"

High levels of this organic acid can be found in tumors or biofluids surrounding tumors. Its oncogenic action appears to due to its ability to inhibit prolyl hydroxylase-containing enzymes. In many tumours, oxygen availability becomes limited (hypoxia) very quickly due to rapid cell proliferation and limited blood vessel growth. The major regulator of the response to hypoxia is the HIF transcription factor (HIF-alpha). Under normal oxygen levels, protein levels of HIF-alpha are very low due to constant degradation, mediated by a series of post-translational modification events catalyzed by the prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes PHD1, 2 and 3, (also known as EglN2, 1 and 3) that hydroxylate HIF-alpha and lead to its degradation.

It is a secondary bile acid produced by the action of enzymes existing in the microbial flora of the colonic environment.  Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium and Lactobacillus are involved in bile acid metabolism and produce glycocholic acid (PMID: 6265737; 10629797). In hepatocytes, both primary and secondary bile acids undergo amino acid conjugation at the C-24 carboxylic acid on the side chain, and almost all bile acids in the bile duct therefore exist in a glycine conjugated form (PMID: 16949895). More specifically, glycocholic acid or cholylglycine, is a crystalline bile acid involved in the emulsification of fats. It occurs as a sodium salt in the bile of mammals. Its anion is called glycocholate. As the glycine conjugate of cholic acid, this compound acts as a detergent to solubilize fats for absorption and is itself absorbed (PubChem). Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues (PMID: 11316487, 16037564, 12576301, 11907135).

It is a compound that is secreted excessively in the urine by patients suffering from D-glyceric aciduria, an inborn error of metabolism, and D-glycerate anemia. Deficiency of human glycerate kinase leads to D-glycerate acidemia/D-glyceric aciduria. Symptoms of the disease include progressive neurological impairment, hypotonia, seizures, failure to thrive, and metabolic acidosis. At sufficiently high levels, glyceric acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Glyceric acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated glyceric aciduria. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures. Elevated values may also be due to microbial sources such as yeast (Aspergillus, Penicillium, probably Candida) or due to dietary sources containing glycerol (glycerine). Glyceric acid is isolated from various plants (e.g. brassicas, pulses, and Vicia faba).",HMDB0000139_nmroned_1106_28262.txt,nmroned,"glyceric acid alpha,beta-hydroxypropionic acid d-groa r-glyceric acid glycerate (r)-glycerate a,b-hydroxypropionate a,b-hydroxypropionic acid alpha,beta-hydroxypropionate r-glycerate (r)-glyceric acid d-glycerate d-glyceric acid (2r)-2,3-dihydroxypropanoic acid (r)-2,3-dihydroxypropanoic acid d-2,3-dihydroxypropanoic acid"

Formate is an intermediate in normal metabolism. It takes part in the metabolism of one-carbon compounds and its carbon may appear in methyl groups undergoing transmethylation. It is eventually oxidized to carbon dioxide. Formate is typically produced as a byproduct in the production of acetate. It is responsible for both metabolic acidosis and disrupting mitochondrial electron transport and energy production by inhibiting cytochrome oxidase activity, the terminal electron acceptor of the electron transport chain. Cell death from cytochrome oxidase inhibition by formate is believed to result partly from depletion of ATP, reducing energy concentrations so that essential cell functions cannot be maintained. Furthermore, inhibition of cytochrome oxidase by formate may also cause cell death by increased production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) secondary to the blockade of the electron transport chain. In nature, formic acid is found in the stings and bites of many insects of the order Hymenoptera, including bees and ants. The principal use of formic acid is as a preservative and antibacterial agent in livestock feed. When sprayed on fresh hay or other silage, it arrests certain decay processes and causes the feed to retain its nutritive value longer.

Metabolic pathways for D-galactose are important not only for the provision of these pathways but also for the prevention of D-galactose metabolite accumulation. The main source of D-galactose is lactose in the milk of mammals, but it can also be found in some fruits and vegetables.

In the presence of D-galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (E.C. 2.7.7.12) (GALT) D-galactose-1-phosphate is exchanged with glucose-1-phosphate in UDP-glucose to form UDP-galactose. Glucose-1-phosphate will then enter the glycolytic pathway for energy production. Deficiency of the enzyme GALT in galactosemic patients leads to the accumulation of D-galactose-1-phosphate.

as L-glutamic acid or as glutamate, the name of its anion, is an alpha-amino acid. These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. L-glutamic acid is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Glutamic acid is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as an acidic, charged (at physiological pH), aliphatic amino acid. In humans it is a non-essential amino acid and can be synthesized via alanine or aspartic acid via alpha-ketoglutarate and the action of various transaminases. Glutamate also plays an important role in the body's disposal of excess or waste nitrogen. Glutamate undergoes deamination, an oxidative reaction catalysed by glutamate dehydrogenase leading to alpha-ketoglutarate. In many respects glutamate is a key molecule in cellular metabolism. Glutamate is the most abundant fast excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system. At chemical synapses, glutamate is stored in vesicles. Nerve impulses trigger release of glutamate from the pre-synaptic cell. In the opposing post-synaptic cell, glutamate receptors, such as the NMDA receptor, bind glutamate and are activated. Because of its role in synaptic plasticity, it is believed that glutamic acid is involved in cognitive functions like learning and memory in the brain. Glutamate transporters are found in neuronal and glial membranes. They rapidly remove glutamate from the extracellular space. In brain injury or disease, they can work in reverse and excess glutamate can accumulate outside cells. This process causes calcium ions to enter cells via NMDA receptor channels, leading to neuronal damage and eventual cell death, and is called excitotoxicity. The mechanisms of cell death include: Damage to mitochondria from excessively high intracellular Ca2+. Glu/Ca2+-mediated promotion of transcription factors for pro-apoptotic genes, or downregulation of transcription factors for anti-apoptotic genes. Excitotoxicity due to glutamate occurs as part of the ischemic cascade and is associated with stroke and diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, lathyrism, and Alzheimer's disease. Glutamic acid has been implicated in epileptic seizures. Microinjection of glutamic acid into neurons produces spontaneous depolarization around one second apart, and this firing pattern is similar to what is known as paroxysmal depolarizing shift in epileptic attacks. This change in the resting membrane potential at seizure foci could cause spontaneous opening of voltage activated calcium channels, leading to glutamic acid release and further depolarization (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid). Glutamate was discovered in 1866 when it was extracted from wheat gluten (from where it got its name. Glutamate has an important role as a food additive and food flavoring agent. In 1908, Japanese researcher Kikunae Ikeda identified brown crystals left behind after the evaporation of a large amount of kombu broth (a Japanese soup) as glutamic acid. These crystals, when tasted, reproduced a salty, savory flavor detected in many foods, most especially in seaweed. Professor Ikeda termed this flavor umami. He then patented a method of mass-producing a crystalline salt of glutamic acid, monosodium glutamate.",HMDB0000148_nmroned_1109_28277.txt,nmroned,"l-glutamic acid (s)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (s)-glutamic acid acide glutamique acido glutamico acidum glutamicum e glu glutamate glutamic acid l-glu l-glutaminic acid l-glutaminsaeure (s)-2-aminopentanedioate (s)-glutamate l-glutaminate l-glutamate (2s)-2-aminopentanedioate (2s)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (s)-(+)-glutamate (s)-(+)-glutamic acid 1-amino-propane-1,3-dicarboxylate 1-amino-propane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid 1-aminopropane-1,3-dicarboxylate 1-aminopropane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid 2-aminoglutarate 2-aminoglutaric acid 2-aminopentanedioate 2-aminopentanedioic acid a-aminoglutarate a-aminoglutaric acid a-glutamate a-glutamic acid aciglut alpha-aminoglutarate alpha-aminoglutaric acid alpha-glutamate alpha-glutamic acid aminoglutarate aminoglutaric acid glt glusate glut glutacid glutamicol glutamidex glutaminate glutaminic acid glutaminol glutaton l-(+)-glutamate l-(+)-glutamic acid l-a-aminoglutarate l-a-aminoglutaric acid l-alpha-aminoglutarate l-alpha-aminoglutaric acid d glutamate glutamate, potassium glutamic acid, (d)-isomer l glutamic acid d-glutamate l glutamate aluminum l glutamate aluminum l-glutamate l-glutamate, aluminum potassium glutamate 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucose d-glcnac n-acetyl-d-glucosamine n-acetylchitosamine n acetyl d glucosamine 2 acetamido 2 deoxy d glucose 2 acetamido 2 deoxyglucose 2-acetamido-2-deoxyglucose acetylglucosamine 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholan-24-oylglycine n-[(3alpha,5beta,7alpha,12alpha)-3,7,12-trihydroxy-24-oxocholan-24-yl]glycine n-choloylglycine 3a,7a,12a-trihydroxy-5b-cholan-24-oylglycine 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oylglycine n-[(3a,5b,7a,12a)-3,7,12-trihydroxy-24-oxocholan-24-yl]glycine n-[(3α,5β,7α,12α)-3,7,12-trihydroxy-24-oxocholan-24-yl]glycine glycocholate glycine cholate glycocholic acid, sodium salt cholylglycine glycocholate sodium 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholanic acid-24-glycine 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-n-(carboxymethyl)-5beta-cholan-24-amide 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholanic acid-24-glycine 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-n-(carboxymethyl)-5β-cholan-24-amide glycoreductodehydrocholic acid glycylcholate glycylcholic acid n-(carboxymethyl)-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholan-24-amide n-(carboxymethyl)-3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-amide n-choloyl-glycine 3-hydroxy-1,3,5(10)-estratrien-17-one follicular hormone folliculin oestrone (+)-estrone 1,3,5(10)-estratrien-3-ol-17-one 3-hydroxy-17-keto-estra-1,3,5-triene 3-hydroxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-one 3-hydroxyestra-1,3,5(10)-triene-17-one 3-hydroxyoestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-one d1,3,5(10)-estratrien-3-ol-17-one estrone, (+-)-isomer hyrex brand of estrone estrone, (9 beta)-isomer estrovarin kestrone wehgen estrone, (8 alpha)-isomer hauck brand of estrone unigen vortech brand of estrone alpha,beta-hydroxypropionic acid d-groa r-glyceric acid glycerate (r)-glycerate a,b-hydroxypropionate a,b-hydroxypropionic acid alpha,beta-hydroxypropionate α,β-hydroxypropionate α,β-hydroxypropionic acid r-glycerate (r)-glyceric acid d-glycerate d-glyceric acid (2r)-2,3-dihydroxypropanoic acid (r)-2,3-dihydroxypropanoic acid d-2,3-dihydroxypropanoic acid 1-amino-2-hydroxyethane 2-amino-1-ethanol 2-amino-ethanol 2-aminoethan-1-ol 2-aminoethyl alcohol 2-hydroxyethylamine aethanolamin aminoethanol beta-aminoethanol beta-aminoethyl alcohol beta-ethanolamine beta-hydroxyethylamine colamine eta glycinol hea mea monoethanolamine b-aminoethanol β-aminoethanol b-aminoethyl alcohol β-aminoethyl alcohol b-ethanolamine β-ethanolamine b-hydroxyethylamine β-hydroxyethylamine 2-aminoethanol 2-ethanolamine 2-hydroxyethanamine envision conditioner pdd 9020 ethylolamine h-glycinol monoaethanolamin olamine 2 aminoethanol (3r,4s,5r)-5-[(1r)-1-carboxy-2,2-difluoro-1-(phosphonooxy)ethoxy]-4-hydroxy-3-(phosphonooxy)cyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylate (1s)-2-[(3-o-b-d-glucopyranosyl-b-d-galactopyranosyl)oxy]-1-{[(9e)-octadec-9-enoyloxy]methyl}ethyl (10e)-nonadec-10-enoate (1s)-2-[(3-o-b-d-glucopyranosyl-b-d-galactopyranosyl)oxy]-1-{[(9e)-octadec-9-enoyloxy]methyl}ethyl (10e)-nonadec-10-enoic acid (1s)-2-[(3-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl-beta-d-galactopyranosyl)oxy]-1-{[(9e)-octadec-9-enoyloxy]methyl}ethyl (10e)-nonadec-10-enoic acid (1s)-2-[(3-o-β-d-glucopyranosyl-β-d-galactopyranosyl)oxy]-1-{[(9e)-octadec-9-enoyloxy]methyl}ethyl (10e)-nonadec-10-enoate (1s)-2-[(3-o-β-d-glucopyranosyl-β-d-galactopyranosyl)oxy]-1-{[(9e)-octadec-9-enoyloxy]methyl}ethyl (10e)-nonadec-10-enoic acid"

Ethanolamine is a colorless, viscous liquid with an odor reminiscent of ammonia. In pharmaceutical formulations, ethanolamine is used primarily for buffering or preparation of emulsions. Ethanolamine can also be used as pH regulator in cosmetics. Biologically, ethanolamine is an initial precursor for the biosynthesis of two primary phospholipid classes, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). In this regard, ethanolamine is the second-most-abundant head group for phospholipids. Ethanolamine serves as a precursor for a variety of N-acylethanolamines (NAEs). These are molecules that modulate several animal and plant physiological processes such as seed germination, plant‚Äìpathogen interactions, chloroplast development and flowering (PMID: 30190434). Ethanolamine, when combined with arachidonic acid (C20H32O2; 20:4, œâ-6), can also form the endocannabinoid anandamide. Ethanolamine can be converted to phosphoethanolamine via the enzyme known as ethanolamine kinase. the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and ethanolamine, whereas its two products are ADP and O-phosphoethanolamine. In most plants ethanolamine is biosynthesized by decarboxylation of serine via a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent l-serine decarboxylase (SDC).

Gluconolactone is a lactone of D-gluconic acid. Gluconolactone can be produced by enzymatic oxidation of D-glucose via the enzyme glucose oxidase. It is a fundamental metabolite found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals. Gluconolactone has metal chelating, moisturizing and antioxidant activities. Its ability in free radicals scavenging accounts for its antioxidant properties. Gluconolactone, is also used as a food additive with the E-number E575. In foods it is used as a sequestrant, an acidifier or a curing, pickling, or leavening agent. Gluconolactone is also used as a coagulant in tofu processing. Gluconolactone is widely used as a skin exfoliant in cosmetic products, where it is noted for its mild exfoliating and hydrating properties. Pure gluconolactone is a white odorless crystalline powder. It is pH-neutral, but hydrolyses in water to gluconic acid which is acidic, adding a tangy taste to foods.

Estradiol is produced in the ovaries. The ovary requires both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to produce sex steroids. LH stimulates the cells surrounding the follicle to produce progesterone and androgens. The androgens diffuse across the basement membrane to the granulosa cell layer, where, under the action of FSH, they are aromatized to estrogens, mainly estradiol. The ovary shows cyclical activity, unlike the testis that is maintained in a more or less constant state of activity. Hormone secretions vary according to the phase of the menstrual cycle. In the developing follicle LH receptors (LH-R) are only located on the thecal cells and FSH receptors (FSHR) on the granulosa cells. The dominant pre-ovulatory follicle develops LH-Rs on the granulosa cells prior to the LH surge. Thecal cells of the preovulatory follicle also develop the capacity to synthesize estradiol and this persists when the thecal cells become incorporated into the corpus luteum. After ovulation, the empty follicle is remodelled and plays an important role in the second half or luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. This phase is dominated by progesterone and, to a lesser extent, estradiol secretion by the corpus luteum. estradiol is also synthesized locally from cholesterol through testosterone in the hippocampus and acts rapidly to modulate neuronal synaptic plasticity. Localization of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in spines in addition to nuclei of principal neurons implies that synaptic ERalpha is responsible for rapid modulation of synaptic plasticity by endogenous estradiol. estradiol is a potent endogenous antioxidant which suppresses hepatic fibrosis in animal models, and attenuates induction of redox sensitive transcription factors, hepatocyte apoptosis and hepatic stellate cells activation by inhibiting a generation of reactive oxygen species in primary cultures. This suggests that the greater progression of hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in men and postmenopausal women may be due, at least in part, to lower production of estradiol and a reduced response to the action of estradiol. estradiol has been reported to induce the production of interferon (INF)-gamma in lymphocytes, and augments an antigen-specific primary antibody response in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. IFN-gamma is a potent cytokine with immunomodulatory and antiproliferative properties. Therefore, female subjects, particularly before menopause, may produce antibodies against hepatitis B virus e antigen and hepatitis B virus surface antigen at a higher frequency than males with chronic hepatitis B virus infection.

The latter metabolites can be formed in the brain and may compete with receptors for catecholamines. Metabolites are conjugated with sulfate or glucuronide before excretion by the kidney. During pregnancy, estriol constitutes 60-70% of the total estrogens, increasing to 300-500-fold in relation to non-pregnant women. The late term human fetus produces relatively large amounts of 16 alphahydroxy DHEA, which serves the mother as a precursor of estriol. It has been shown that 90% of the precursors for the formation of estriol are of fetal origin.

Apples contain malic acid, which contributes to the sourness of a green apple. Malic acid can make a wine taste tart, although the amount decreases with increasing fruit ripeness (Wikipedia). In its ionized form, malic acid is called malate. Malate is an intermediate of the TCA cycle along with fumarate. It can also be formed from pyruvate as one of the anaplerotic reactions. In humans, malic acid is both derived from food sources and synthesized in the body through the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle which takes place in the mitochondria. Malate's importance to the production of energy in the body during both aerobic and anaerobic conditions is well established. Under aerobic conditions, the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate provides reducing equivalents to the mitochondria through the malate-aspartate redox shuttle. During anaerobic conditions, where a buildup of excess reducing equivalents inhibits glycolysis, malic acid's simultaneous reduction to succinate and oxidation to oxaloacetate is capable of removing the accumulating reducing equivalents. This allows malic acid to reverse hypoxia's inhibition of glycolysis and energy production. In studies on rats, it has been found that only tissue malate is depleted following exhaustive physical activity. Other key metabolites from the citric acid cycle needed for energy production were found to be unchanged. Because of this, a deficiency of malic acid has been hypothesized to be a major cause of physical exhaustion. Notably, the administration of malic acid to rats has been shown to elevate mitochondrial malate and increase mitochondrial respiration and energy production. Malic acid has been found to be a metabolite in Aspergillus (Hugo Vanden Bossche, D.W.R. Mackenzie and G. Cauwenbergh. Aspergillus and Aspergillosis, 1987).",HMDB0000156_nmroned_1115_28302.txt,nmroned,"malic acid (-)-l-malic acid (s)-(-)-hydroxysuccinic acid l-2-hydroxybutanedioic acid l-apple acid malate malic acid s-2-hydroxybutanedioic acid l-malate (-)-l-malate (s)-(-)-hydroxysuccinate l-2-hydroxybutanedioate s-2-hydroxybutanedioate (-)-(s)-malate (-)-(s)-malic acid (-)-hydroxysuccinate (-)-hydroxysuccinic acid (-)-malic acid (2s)-2-hydroxybutanedioate (2s)-2-hydroxybutanedioic acid (s)-hydroxy-butanedioate (s)-hydroxy-butanedioic acid (s)-hydroxybutanedioate (s)-hydroxybutanedioic acid (s)-malic acid apple acid l-(-)-malic acid l-hydroxybutanedioate l-hydroxybutanedioic acid l-hydroxysuccinate l-hydroxysuccinic acid s-(-)-malate s-(-)-malic acid (s)-malate l-malic acid (2s)-2-hydroxysuccinic acid (2s)-malic acid (s)-2-hydroxysuccinic acid 2-hydroxybutanedioic acid 2-hydroxyethane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid 2-hydroxysuccinic acid deoxytetraric acid hydroxybutanedioic acid hydroxysuccinic acid monohydroxybutanedioic acid alpha-hydroxysuccinic acid α-hydroxysuccinic acid"

Purines are a bicyclic aromatic compound made up of a pyrimidine ring fused to an imidazole ring. Hypoxanthine is also classified as an oxopurine, Hypoxanthine is a naturally occurring purine derivative and a reaction intermediate in the metabolism of adenosine and in the formation of nucleic acids by the nucleotide salvage pathway. Hypoxanthine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Hypoxanthine has been detected, but not quantified in, several different foods, such as radish (var.), mountain yams, welsh onions, greenthread tea, and common beets. Hypoxanthine is occasionally found as a constituent of nucleic acids, where it is present in the anticodon of tRNA in the form of its nucleoside inosine. Biologically, hypoxanthine can be formed a number of ways. For instance, it is one of the products of the action of xanthine oxidase on xanthine. However, more frequently xanthine is formed from oxidation of hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidoreductase. The enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase converts hypoxanthine into IMP in the nucleotide salvage pathway. Hypoxanthine is also a spontaneous deamination product of adenine. Under normal circumstances hypoxanthine is readily converted to uric acid. In this process, hypoxanthine is first oxidized to xanthine, which is further oxidized to uric acid by xanthine oxidase. Molecular oxygen, the oxidant in both reactions, is reduced to H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species. In humans, uric acid is the final product of purine degradation and is excreted in the urine. Within humans, hypoxanthine participates in a number of other enzymatic reactions. In particular, hypoxanthine and ribose 1-phosphate can be biosynthesized from inosine through its interaction with the enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Hypoxanthine is also involved in the metabolic disorder called the purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency is a disorder of the immune system (primary immunodeficiency) characterized by recurrent infections, neurologic symptoms, and autoimmune disorders. PNP deficiency causes a shortage of white blood cells, called T-cells, that help fight infection. Affected individuals develop neurologic symptoms, such as stiff or rigid muscles (spasticity), uncoordinated movements (ataxia), developmental delay, and intellectual disability. PNP deficiency is associated with an increased risk to develop autoimmune disorders, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), autoimmune neutropenia, thyroiditis, and lupus.",HMDB0000157_nmroned_1116_28306.txt,nmroned,"hypoxanthine 6(1h)-purinone 6-oxopurine 9h-purin-6(1h)-one hyp purin-6(1h)-one purine-6-ol 1,7-dihydro-6h-purin-6-one 1,7-dihydro-6h-purine-6-one 1h,7h-hypoxanthine 3h-purin-6-ol 4-hydroxy-1h-purine 6-hydroxy-1h-purine 6-hydroxypurine 7h-purin-6-ol 9h-purin-6-ol hypoxanthine enol purin-6(3h)-one purin-6-ol sarcine sarkin sarkine"

The conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine is catalyzed by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, a monooxygenase. This enzyme catalyzes the reaction causing the addition of a hydroxyl group to the end of the 6-carbon aromatic ring of phenylalanine, such that it becomes tyrosine. Tyrosine is found in many high-protein food products such as chicken, turkey, fish, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheese, peanuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, soy products, lima beans, avocados and bananas. Tyrosine is one of the few amino acids that readily passes the blood-brain barrier. Once in the brain, it is a precursor for the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine, better known as adrenalin. These neurotransmitters are an important part of the body's sympathetic nervous system, and their concentrations in the body and brain are directly dependent upon dietary tyrosine. Tyrosine is not found in large concentrations throughout the body, probably because it is rapidly metabolized. Folic acid, copper and vitamin C are cofactor nutrients of these reactions. Tyrosine is also the precursor for hormones, including thyroid hormones (diiodotyrosine), catecholestrogens and the major human pigment, melanin. Tyrosine is an important amino acid in many proteins, peptides and even enkephalins, the body's natural pain reliever. Valine and other branched amino acids, and possibly tryptophan and phenylalanine may reduce tyrosine absorption. A number of genetic errors of tyrosine metabolism have been identified, such as hawkinsinuria and tyrosinemia I. The most common feature of these diseases is the increased amount of tyrosine in the blood, which is marked by decreased motor activity, lethargy and poor feeding. Infection and intellectual deficits may occur. Vitamin C supplements can help reverse these disease symptoms. Some adults also develop elevated tyrosine in their blood. This typically indicates a need for more vitamin C. More tyrosine is needed under stress, and tyrosine supplements prevent the stress-induced depletion of norepinephrine and can help aleviate biochemical depression. However, tyrosine may not be good for treating psychosis. Many antipsychotic medications apparently function by inhibiting tyrosine metabolism. L-Dopa, which is directly used in Parkinson's, is made from tyrosine. Tyrosine, the nutrient, can be used as an adjunct in the treatment of Parkinson's. Peripheral metabolism of tyrosine necessitates large doses of tyrosine, however, compared to L-Dopa (http://www.dcnutrition.com). In addition to its role as a precursor for neurotransmitters, tyrosine plays an important role for the function of many proteins.  Within many proteins or enzymes, certain tyrosine residues can be tagged (at the hydroxyl group) with a phosphate group (phosphorylated) by specialized protein kinases. In its phosphorylated form, tyrosine is called phosphotyrosine. Tyrosine phosphorylation is considered to be one of the key steps in signal transduction and regulation of enzymatic activity.  Tyrosine (or its precursor phenylalanine) is also needed to synthesize the benzoquinone structure which forms part of coenzyme Q10.",HMDB0000158_nmroned_1117_28311.txt,nmroned,"l-tyrosine (-)-alpha-amino-p-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid (2s)-2-amino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (s)-(-)-tyrosine (s)-2-amino-3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (s)-3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)alanine (s)-alpha-amino-4-hydroxybenzenepropanoic acid (s)-tyrosine 4-hydroxy-l-phenylalanine l-tyrosin tyr tyrosine y (-)-a-amino-p-hydroxyhydrocinnamate (-)-a-amino-p-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid (-)-alpha-amino-p-hydroxyhydrocinnamate (-)-α-amino-p-hydroxyhydrocinnamate (-)-α-amino-p-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid (2s)-2-amino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoate (s)-2-amino-3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionate (s)-a-amino-4-hydroxybenzenepropanoate (s)-a-amino-4-hydroxybenzenepropanoic acid (s)-alpha-amino-4-hydroxybenzenepropanoate (s)-α-amino-4-hydroxybenzenepropanoate (s)-α-amino-4-hydroxybenzenepropanoic acid (s)-a-amino-4-hydroxy-benzenepropanoate (s)-a-amino-4-hydroxy-benzenepropanoic acid (s)-alpha-amino-4-hydroxy-benzenepropanoate (s)-alpha-amino-4-hydroxy-benzenepropanoic acid 2-amino-3-(4-hydroxyphen yl)-2-amino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propanoate 2-amino-3-(4-hydroxyphen yl)-2-amino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propanoic acid 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-l-alanine benzenepropanoate benzenepropanoic acid l-p-tyrosine p-tyrosine l tyrosine tyrosine, l-isomer tyrosine, l isomer para tyrosine para-tyrosine"

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. L-phenylalanine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Phenylalanine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as an aromatic, non-polar amino acid. In humans, phenylalanine is an essential amino acid and the precursor of the amino acid tyrosine. Like tyrosine, phenylalanine is also a precursor for catecholamines including tyramine, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Catecholamines are neurotransmitters that act as adrenalin-like substances. Interestingly, several psychotropic drugs (mescaline, morphine, codeine, and papaverine) also have phenylalanine as a constituent. Phenylalanine is highly concentrated in the human brain and plasma. Normal metabolism of phenylalanine requires biopterin, iron, niacin, vitamin B6, copper, and vitamin C. An average adult ingests 5 g of phenylalanine per day and may optimally need up to 8 g daily. Phenylalanine is highly concentrated in a number of high protein foods, such as meat, cottage cheese, and wheat germ. An additional dietary source of phenylalanine is artificial sweeteners containing aspartame (a methyl ester of the aspartic acid/phenylalanine dipeptide). As a general rule, aspartame should be avoided by phenylketonurics and pregnant women. When present in sufficiently high levels, phenylalanine can act as a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that disrupts or attacks neural cells and neural tissue. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of phenylalanine are associated with at least five inborn errors of metabolism, including Hartnup disorder, hyperphenylalaninemia due to guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase deficiency, phenylketonuria (PKU), tyrosinemia type 2 (or Richner-Hanhart syndrome), and tyrosinemia type III (TYRO3). Phenylketonurics have elevated serum plasma levels of phenylalanine up to 400 times normal. High plasma concentrations of phenylalanine influence the blood-brain barrier transport of large neutral amino acids. The high plasma phenylalanine concentrations increase phenylalanine entry into the brain and restrict the entry of other large neutral amino acids (PMID: 19191004). Phenylalanine has been found to interfere with different cerebral enzyme systems. Untreated phenylketonuria (PKU) can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioural problems, and mental disorders. It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin. Classic PKU dramatically affects myelination and white matter tracts in untreated infants; this may be one major cause of neurological disorders associated with phenylketonuria. Mild phenylketonuria can act as an unsuspected cause of hyperactivity, learning problems, and other developmental problems in children. It has been recently suggested that PKU may resemble amyloid diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, due to the formation of toxic amyloid-like assemblies of phenylalanine (PMID: 22706200). Phenylalanine also has some potential benefits. Phenylalanine can act as an effective pain reliever. Its use in premenstrual syndrome and Parkinson's may enhance the effects of acupuncture and electric transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS). Phenylalanine and tyrosine, like L-DOPA, produce a catecholamine-like effect. Phenylalanine is better absorbed than tyrosine and may cause fewer headaches. Low phenylalanine diets have been prescribed for certain cancers with mixed results. For instance, some tumours use more phenylalanine than others (particularly melatonin-producing tumours called melanomas).",HMDB0000159_nmroned_1118_28315.txt,nmroned,"l-phenylalanine (s)-2-amino-3-phenylpropionic acid (s)-alpha-amino-beta-phenylpropionic acid 3-phenyl-l-alanine beta-phenyl-l-alanine f phe phenylalanine (s)-2-amino-3-phenylpropionate (s)-a-amino-b-phenylpropionate (s)-a-amino-b-phenylpropionic acid (s)-alpha-amino-beta-phenylpropionate (s)-α-amino-β-phenylpropionate (s)-α-amino-β-phenylpropionic acid b-phenyl-l-alanine β-phenyl-l-alanine (-)-beta-phenylalanine (l)-phenylalanine (s)-(-)-phenylalanine (s)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoate (s)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (s)-alpha-amino-benzenepropanoate (s)-alpha-amino-benzenepropanoic acid (s)-alpha-aminobenzenepropanoate (s)-alpha-aminobenzenepropanoic acid (s)-alpha-aminohydrocinnamate (s)-alpha-aminohydrocinnamic acid (s)-phenylalanine alpha-aminohydrocinnamate alpha-aminohydrocinnamic acid beta-phenyl-alpha-alanine beta-phenylalanine l-2-amino-3-phenylpropionate l-2-amino-3-phenylpropionic acid phenyl-alanine phenylalamine l-isomer phenylalanine phenylalanine, l isomer phenylalanine, l-isomer endorphenyl (6s)-tetrahydrofolate (6s)-tetrahydrofolic acid (6s)-thfa 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate tetrahydrofolate thf 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid"

L-alanine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Alanine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as an aliphatic, non-polar amino acid. In humans, alanine is a non-essential amino acid that can be easily made in the body from either the conversion of pyruvate or the breakdown of the dipeptides carnosine and anserine. Alanine can be also synthesized from branched chain amino acids such as valine, leucine, and isoleucine. Alanine is produced by reductive amination of pyruvate through a two-step process. In the first step, alpha-ketoglutarate, ammonia and NADH are converted by the enzyme known glutamate dehydrogenase to glutamate, NAD+ and water. In the second step, the amino group of the newly-formed glutamate is transferred to pyruvate by an aminotransferase enzyme, regenerating the alpha-ketoglutarate, and converting the pyruvate to alanine. The net result is that pyruvate and ammonia are converted to alanine. In mammals, alanine plays a key role in glucose‚Äìalanine cycle between tissues and liver. In muscle and other tissues that degrade amino acids for fuel, amino groups are collected in the form of glutamate by transamination. Glutamate can then transfer its amino group to pyruvate, a product of muscle glycolysis, through the action of alanine aminotransferase, forming alanine and alpha-ketoglutarate. The alanine enters the bloodstream and is transported to the liver. The alanine aminotransferase reaction takes place in reverse in the liver, where the regenerated pyruvate is used in gluconeogenesis, forming glucose which returns to the muscles through the circulation system. Alanine is highly concentrated in muscle and is one of the most important amino acids released by muscle, functioning as a major energy source. Plasma alanine is often decreased when the BCAA (branched-chain amino acids) are deficient. This finding may relate to muscle metabolism. Alanine is highly concentrated in meat products and other high-protein foods like wheat germ and cottage cheese. Alanine is an important participant as well as a regulator of glucose metabolism. Alanine levels parallel blood sugar levels in both diabetes and hypoglycemia, and alanine is reduced in both severe hypoglycemia and the ketosis of diabetes. Alanine is an important amino acid for lymphocyte reproduction and immunity. Alanine therapy has helped dissolve kidney stones in experimental animals. Normal alanine metabolism, like that of other amino acids, is highly dependent upon enzymes that contain vitamin B6.

It is classified as an aliphatic, non-polar amino acid. Proline is sometimes called an imino acid, although the IUPAC definition of an imine requires a carbon-nitrogen double bond. Proline is a non-essential amino acid that is synthesized from glutamic acid. It is an essential component of collagen and is important for proper functioning of joints and tendons. Proline is derived from the amino acid L-glutamate in which glutamate-5-semialdehyde is first formed by glutamate 5-kinase and glutamate-5-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (which requires NADH or NADPH). This semialdehyde can then either spontaneously cyclize to form 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid, which is reduced to proline by pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase, or turned into ornithine by ornithine aminotransferase, followed by cyclization by ornithine cyclodeaminase to form proline. L-Proline has been found to act as a weak agonist of the glycine receptor and of both NMDA and non-NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors. It has been proposed to be a potential endogenous excitotoxin/neurotoxin. Studies in rats have shown that when injected into the brain, proline non-selectively destroys pyramidal and granule cells (PMID: 3409032 ). Therefore, under certain conditions proline can act as a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of proline are associated with at least five inborn errors of metabolism, including hyperprolinemia type I, hyperprolinemia type II, iminoglycinuria, prolinemia type II, and pyruvate carboxylase deficiency. People with hyperprolinemia type I often do not show any symptoms even though they have proline levels in their blood between 3 and 10 times the normal level. Some individuals with hyperprolinemia type I exhibit seizures, intellectual disability, or other neurological or psychiatric problems. Hyperprolinemia type II results in proline levels in the blood between 10 and 15 times higher than normal, and high levels of a related compound called pyrroline-5-carboxylate.

Its name comes from malt, combined with the suffix '-ose' which is used in names of sugars. Maltose is a key structural motif of starch. When alpha-amylase breaks down starch, it removes two glucose units at a time, producing maltose. Maltose can be further broken down to glucose by the maltase enzyme, which catalyses the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond. D-maltose exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Within humans, D-maltose participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, maltose can be converted into glucose; which is mediated by the enzyme maltase-glucoamylase. In addition, maltose can be converted into glucose through its interaction with the enzyme glycogen debranching enzyme. Maltose is found in high concentrations in oriental wheats and in a lower concentrations in sweet potato, grape wines, yellow pond-lilies, sunflowers, and spinach. Maltose is a component of malt, a substance which is obtained in the process of allowing grain to soften in water and germinate.

Interestingly, methylamine and ammonia levels are reciprocally controlled by a semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase activity that deaminates methylamine to formaldehyde with the production of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide. Methylamine also targets the voltage-operated neuronal potassium channels, probably inducing release of neurotransmitter(s). Semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) catalyzes the deamination of primary amines. Such deamination has been shown capable of regulating glucose transport in adipose cells. It has been independently discovered that the primary structure of vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is identical to SSAO. Increased serum SSAO activities have been found in patients with diabetic mellitus, vascular disorders, and Alzheimer's disease. The SSAO-catalyzed deamination of endogenous substrates like methylamine led to production of toxic formaldehyde. Chronic elevated methylamine increases the excretion of malondialdehyde and microalbuminuria. Amine oxidase substrates such as methylamine have been shown to stimulate glucose uptake by increasing the recruitment of the glucose transporter GLUT4 from vesicles within the cell to the cell surface. Inhibition of this effect by the presence of semicarbazide and catalase led to the suggestion that the process is mediated by the hydrogen peroxide produced in the oxidation of these amines (PMID: 16049393 , 12686132 , 17406961).

L-threonine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Threonine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals. It is classified as a polar, uncharged (at physiological pH), aliphatic amino acid. Threonine is sometimes considered as a branched chain amino acid. Threonine was actually the last of the 20 amino acids to be discovered (in 1938). It was named threonine because it was similar in structure to threonic acid, a four-carbon monosaccharide. Threonine is an essential amino acid in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it and that it must be obtained from the diet. Foods high in threonine include cottage cheese, poultry, fish, meat, lentils, black turtle bean and sesame seeds. Adult humans require about 20 mg/kg body weight/day. In plants and microorganisms, threonine is synthesized from aspartic acid via alpha-aspartyl-semialdehyde and homoserine. In proteins, the threonine residue is susceptible to numerous posttranslational modifications. The hydroxyl side-chain can undergo O-linked glycosylation and phosphorylation through the action of a threonine kinase. Threonine is abundant in human plasma, particularly in newborns. Severe deficiency of threonine causes neurological dysfunction and lameness in experimental animals. Threonine is an immunostimulant which promotes the growth of thymus gland. It also can probably promote cell immune defense function. The threonine content of most of the infant formulas currently on the market is approximately 20% higher than the threonine concentration in human milk. Due to this high threonine content the plasma threonine concentrations are up to twice as high in premature infants fed these formulas than in infants fed human milk. The whey proteins which are used for infant formulas are sweet whey proteins. Sweet whey results from cheese production. Increasing the threonine plasma concentrations leads to accumulation of threonine and glycine in the brain. Such accumulation affects the neurotransmitter balance which may have consequences for the brain development during early postnatal life. Thus, excessive threonine intake during infant feeding should be avoided. (PMID 9853925). Threonine is metabolized in at least two ways. In many animals it is converted to pyruvate via threonine dehydrogenase. An intermediate in this pathway can undergo thiolysis with CoA to produce acetyl-CoA and glycine.

Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. L-asparagine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Asparagine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals. In humans, asparagine is not an essential amino acid, which means that it can be synthesized from central metabolic pathway intermediates in humans and is not required in the diet. The precursor to asparagine is oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate is converted to aspartate using a transaminase enzyme. This enzyme transfers the amino group from glutamate to oxaloacetate producing alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. The enzyme asparagine synthetase produces asparagine, AMP, glutamate, and pyrophosphate from aspartate, glutamine, and ATP. In the asparagine synthetase reaction, ATP is used to activate aspartate, forming beta-aspartyl-AMP. Glutamine donates an ammonium group which reacts with beta-aspartyl-AMP to form asparagine and free AMP. Since the asparagine side chain can make efficient hydrogen bond interactions with the peptide backbone, asparagines are often found near the beginning and end of alpha-helices, and in turn motifs in beta sheets. Its role can be thought as ""capping"" the hydrogen bond interactions which would otherwise need to be satisfied by the polypeptide backbone. Asparagine also provides key sites for N-linked glycosylation, a modification of the protein chain that is characterized by the addition of carbohydrate chains. A reaction between asparagine and reducing sugars or reactive carbonyls produces acrylamide (acrylic amide) in food when heated to sufficient temperature (i.e. baking). These occur primarily in baked goods such as French fries, potato chips, and roasted coffee. Asparagine was first isolated in 1806 from asparagus juice --hence its name. Asparagine was the first amino acid to be isolated. The smell observed in the urine of some individuals after the consumption of asparagus is attributed to a byproduct of the metabolic breakdown of asparagine, asparagine-amino-succinic-acid monoamide.

It is also classified as an aldohexose. It is fermentable monosaccharide and an isomer of glucose. Mannose commonly exists as two different-sized rings, the pyranose (six-membered) form and the furanose (five-membered) form. Formally, D-Mannose is the 2-epimer of glucose and exists primarily as sweet-tasting alpha- (67%) or as a bitter-tasting beta- (33%) anomer of the pyranose form (PMID: 24931670).  Mannose is not an essential nutrient, meaning that it can be produced in the human body from glucose or converted into glucose. Mannose is ~5x as active as glucose in non-enzyamtic glycation, which may explain why evolution did not favor it as a biological energy source (PMID: 24931670).  Mannose occurs in microbes, plants and animals. Free mannose is found in small amounts in many fruits such as oranges, apples and peaches and in mammalian plasma at 50‚Äì100 uM (PMID: 24931670).   More often, mannose occurs in homo-or hetero-polymers such as yeast mannans (alpha-mannose) where it can account for nearly 16% of dry weight or in galactomannans. Coffee beans, fenugreek and guar gums are rich sources of galactomannans. However, these plant polysaccharides are not degraded in the mammalian GI tract and, therefore, provide very little bio-available mannose for glycan synthesis. The digestion of many polysaccharides and glycoproteins also yields mannose. Once mannose is released, it is phosphorylated by hexokinase to generate mannose-6-phosphate. Mannose-6-phosphate is then converted to fructose-6-phosphate, by the enzyme phosphomannose isomerase, whereupon it enters the glycolytic pathway or is converted to glucose-6-phosphate by the gluconeogenic pathway. Mannose is a dominant monosaccharide in N-linked glycosylation, which is a post-translational modification of proteins. N-linked glycosylation is initiated by the transfer of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to nascent glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum in a co-translational manner as the protein enters the transport system. Typically, mature human glycoproteins only contain three mannose residues buried under sequential modification by GlcNAc, galactose, and sialic acid. High-mannose-type oligosaccharides have been shown to play important roles in protein quality control. Several intracellular proteins such as lectins, chaperones, and glycan-processing enzymes, are involved in this process. These include calnexin/calreticulin, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT), cargo receptors (such as VIP36 and ERGIC-53), mannosidase-like proteins (e.g. EDEM and Htm1p) and ubiquitin ligase (Fbs). They are thought to recognize high-mannose-type glycans with subtly different structures. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an important constituent of the innate immune system. This protein binds through multiple lectin domains to the repeating sugar arrays that decorate many microbial surfaces and is then able to activate the complement system through a specific protease called MBL-associated protease-2. Mannose (D-mannose) is used as a nutritional supplement, packaged as ""D-mannose"", to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections (PMID: 21105658). D-mannose prevents FimH-mediated bacterial adhesion in the urinary tract through a competitive inhibition mechanism. This mechanism is based on the structural similarity between D-mannose and urothelial mannosylated receptors exposed by the epithelium of the urinary tract (PMID: 21105658). When D-mannose is administered in sufficient amounts, it is rapidly absorbed and then excreted by the urinary tract where it saturates bacterial FimH, thereby preventing bacterial binding to urothelial cells.",HMDB0000169_nmroned_5261_2734678.txt,nmroned,d-mannose alpha-d-man a-d-man α-d-man a-d-mannose α-d-mannose alpha-d-mannopyranose a-d-mannopyranose α-d-mannopyranose (+)-mannose carubinose d(+)-mannose mannose seminose alpha-d-mannose alpha-mannose α-mannose

It is classified as a non-polar, uncharged (at physiological pH) aliphatic amino acid. Isoleucine is an essential amino acid in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it and that it must be obtained from the diet. In plants and microorganisms, isoleucine is synthesized starting from pyruvate and alpha-ketobutyrate. Isoleucine is classified as a branched chain amino acid (BCAA). BCAAs include three amino acids: isoleucine, leucine and valine. They are alpha amino acids whose carbon structure is marked by a beta branch point. Despite their structural similarities, BCAAs have different metabolic routes, with valine going solely to carbohydrates (glucogenic), leucine solely to fats (ketogenic) and isoleucine being both a glucogenic and a ketogenic amino acid. Isoleucine is catabolized via with alpha-ketoglutarate where upon it is oxidized and split into propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA. Propionyl-CoA is converted into succinyl-CoA, a TCA cycle intermediate which can be converted into oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis (hence glucogenic). The acetyl-CoA can be fed into the TCA cycle by condensing with oxaloacetate to form citrate or used in the synthesis of ketone bodies or fatty acids. The different metabolism of BCAAs accounts for different requirements for these essential amino acids in humans: 12 mg/kg, 14 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg of valine, leucine and isoleucine are required respectively. Furthermore, these amino acids have different deficiency symptoms. Valine deficiency is marked by neurological defects in the brain, while isoleucine deficiency is marked by muscle tremors. BCAAs are decreased in patients with liver disease, such as hepatitis, hepatic coma, cirrhosis, extrahepatic biliary atresia. An inability to break down isoleucine, along with other amino acids, is associated with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) (PMID: 34125801). Isoleucine, like other BCAAs, is associated with insulin resistance. In particular, higher levels of isoleucine are observed in the blood of diabetic mice, rats, and humans (PMID 25287287).

It is the fundamental subunit of the fucoidan polysaccharide. As a free sugar, L-fucose is normally found at very low levels in mammals. It is unique in that it is the only levorotatory sugar synthesized and utilized by mammals. Fucose polymers are synthesized by fucosyltransferases. All fucosyltransferases utilize a nucleotide-activated form of fucose, GDP-fucose, as a fucose donor in the construction of fucosylated oligosaccharides. The ABO blood group antigens are among the most well known fucosylated glycans. The alpha-1->3 linked core fucose is a suspected carbohydrate antigen for IgE-mediated allergy. Two structural features distinguish fucose from other six-carbon sugars present in mammals: the lack of a hydroxyl group on the carbon at the 6-position (C-6) and the L-configuration. In fucose-containing glycan structures, fucosylated glycans, fucose can exist as a terminal modification or serve as an attachment point for adding other sugars. Fucose is metabolized by an enzyme called alpha-fucosidase. Fucose is secreted in urine when the liver is damaged. Free L-fucose in serum and urine can be used as a marker for cancer, cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease and gastric ulcers (PMID: 2311216, 8488966).

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. Histidine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Histidine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as an aliphatic, positively charged or basic amino acid. Histidine is a unique amino acid with an imidazole functional group. The acid-base properties of the imidazole side chain are relevant to the catalytic mechanism of many enzymes such as proteases. In catalytic triads, the basic nitrogen of histidine abstracts a proton from serine, threonine, or cysteine to activate it as a nucleophile. In a histidine proton shuttle, histidine is used to quickly shuttle protons. It can do this by abstracting a proton with its basic nitrogen to make a positively charged intermediate and then use another molecule to extract the proton from its acidic nitrogen. Histidine forms complexes with many metal ions. The imidazole sidechain of the histidine residue commonly serves as a ligand in metalloproteins. Histidine was first isolated by German physician Albrecht Kossel in 1896. Histidine is an essential amino acid in humans and other mammals. It was initially thought that it was only essential for infants, but longer-term studies established that it is also essential for adults. Infants four to six months old require 33 mg/kg of histidine. It is not clear how adults make small amounts of histidine, and dietary sources probably account for most of the histidine in the body. Histidine is a precursor for histamine and carnosine biosynthesis. Inborn errors of histidine metabolism, including histidinemia, maple syrup urine disease, propionic acidemia, and tyrosinemia I, exist and are marked by increased histidine levels in the blood. Elevated blood histidine is accompanied by a wide range of symptoms, from mental and physical retardation to poor intellectual functioning, emotional instability, tremor, ataxia and psychosis. Histidine and other imidazole compounds have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-secretory properties (PMID: 9605177 ). The efficacy of L-histidine in protecting inflamed tissue is attributed to the capacity of the imidazole ring to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by cells during acute inflammatory response (PMID: 9605177 ). Histidine, when administered in therapeutic quantities is able to inhibit cytokines and growth factors involved in cell and tissue damage (US patent 6150392). Histidine in medical therapies has its most promising trials in rheumatoid arthritis where up to 4.5 g daily have been used effectively in severely affected patients. Arthritis patients have been found to have low serum histidine levels, apparently because of very rapid removal of histidine from their blood (PMID: 1079527 ). Other patients besides arthritis patients that have been found to be low in serum histidine are those with chronic renal failure. Urinary levels of histidine are reduced in pediatric patients with pneumonia (PMID: 2084459 ). Asthma patients exhibit increased serum levels of histidine over normal controls (PMID: 23517038 ). Serum histidine levels are lower and are negatively associated with inflammation and oxidative stress in obese women (PMID: 23361591 ). Histidine supplementation has been shown to reduce insulin resistance, reduce BMI and fat mass and suppress inflammation and oxidative stress in obese women with metabolic syndrome. Histidine appears to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, possibly via the NF-Œ∫B pathway, in adipocytes (PMID: 23361591 ). Low plasma concentrations of histidine are associated with protein-energy wasting, inflammation, oxidative stress, and greater mortality in chronic kidney disease patients (PMID: 18541578 ). Histidine may have many other possible functions because it is the precursor of the ubiquitous neurohormone-neurotransmitter histamine. Histidine increases histamine in the blood and probably in the brain. Low blood histamine with low serum histidine occurs in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Low blood histamine also occurs in some manic, schizophrenic, high copper and hyperactive groups of psychiatric patients. Histidine is a useful therapy in all patients with low histamine levels (http://www.dcnutrition.com).",HMDB0000177_nmroned_1146_28439.txt,nmroned,"l-histidine (s)-4-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)imidazole (s)-alpha-amino-1h-imidazole-4-propanoic acid (s)-alpha-amino-1h-imidazole-4-propionic acid h his histidine l-(-)-histidine l-histidin (s)-a-amino-1h-imidazole-4-propanoate (s)-a-amino-1h-imidazole-4-propanoic acid (s)-alpha-amino-1h-imidazole-4-propanoate (s)-α-amino-1h-imidazole-4-propanoate (s)-α-amino-1h-imidazole-4-propanoic acid (s)-a-amino-1h-imidazole-4-propionate (s)-a-amino-1h-imidazole-4-propionic acid (s)-alpha-amino-1h-imidazole-4-propionate (s)-α-amino-1h-imidazole-4-propionate (s)-α-amino-1h-imidazole-4-propionic acid (s)-1h-imidazole-4-alanine (s)-2-amino-3-(4-imidazolyl)propionsaeure (s)-histidine (s)1h-imidazole-4-alanine 3-(1h-imidazol-4-yl)-l-alanine amino-1h-imidazole-4-propanoate amino-1h-imidazole-4-propanoic acid amino-4-imidazoleproprionate amino-4-imidazoleproprionic acid glyoxaline-5-alanine histidine, l isomer histidine, l-isomer l-isomer histidine l-histidine"

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  L-DOPA is found naturally in both animals and plants. It is made via biosynthesis from the amino acid L-tyrosine by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase.. L-DOPA is the precursor to the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline), which are collectively known as catecholamines. The Swedish scientist Arvid Carlsson first showed in the 1950s that administering L-DOPA to animals with drug-induced (reserpine) Parkinsonian symptoms caused a reduction in the intensity of the animals' symptoms. Unlike dopamine itself, L-DOPA can be taken orally and crosses the blood-brain barrier. It is rapidly taken up by dopaminergic neurons and converted to dopamine. In particular, it is metabolized to dopamine by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6) is a required cofactor for this decarboxylation, and may be administered along with levodopa, usually as pyridoxine. As a result, L-DOPA is a drug that is now used for the treatment of Parkinsonian disorders and DOPA-Responsive Dystonia. It is usually given with agents that inhibit its conversion to dopamine outside of the central nervous system. It is standard clinical practice in treating Parkinsonism to co-administer a peripheral DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor - carbidopa or benserazide - and often a catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor, to prevent synthesis of dopamine in peripheral tissue. Side effects of L-DOPA treatment may include: hypertension, arrhythmias, nausea, gastrointestinal bleeding, disturbed respiration, hair loss, disorientation and confusion. L-DOPA can act as an L-tyrosine mimetic and be incorporated into proteins by mammalian cells in place of L-tyrosine, generating protease-resistant and aggregate-prone proteins in vitro and may contribute to neurotoxicity with chronic L-DOPA administration. L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine, and L-DOPA are all precursors to the biological pigment melanin. The enzyme tyrosinase catalyzes the oxidation of L-DOPA to the reactive intermediate dopaquinone, which reacts further, eventually leading to melanin oligomers.",HMDB0000181_nmroned_1149_28448.txt,nmroned,"l-dopa (-)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-l-alanine (-)-dopa 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine 3-hydroxy-l-tyrosine beta-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-l-alanine beta-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)alanine dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine dopar l-beta-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)alanine levodopa levodopum b-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-l-alanine β-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-l-alanine b-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)alanine β-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)alanine l-b-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)alanine l-β-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)alanine (2s)-2-amino-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propanoate (2s)-2-amino-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-l-alanine b-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-a-l-alanine bendopa beta-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-alpha-l-alanine cidandopa dihydroxyphenylalanine dopaflex dopaidan dopal dopalina doparkine doparl dopasol dopaston dopastone dopastral dopicar doprin eldopal eldopar eldopatec eurodopa helfo-dopa insulamina l-(-)-dopa l-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-alanine l-4-5-dihydroxyphenylalanine l-b-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-a-alanine l-beta-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-alpha-alanine l-dihydroxyphenylalanine laradopa larodopa ledopa levedopa levopa maipedopa parda pardopa prodopa syndopa veldopa weldopa 3 hydroxy l tyrosine roche brand of levodopa l 3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine medphano brand of levodopa l dopa roberts brand of levodopa"

It is classified as an aliphatic, positively charged or basic amino acid. In humans, lysine is an essential amino acid, meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and it must be obtained from the diet.  Lysine is high in foods such as wheat germ, cottage cheese and chicken. Of meat products, wild game and pork have the highest concentration of lysine. Fruits and vegetables contain little lysine, except avocados. Normal requirements for lysine have been found to be about 8 g per day or 12 mg/kg in adults. Children and infants need more, 44 mg/kg per day for an eleven to-twelve-year old, and 97 mg/kg per day for three-to six-month old. In organisms that synthesise lysine, it has two main biosynthetic pathways, the diaminopimelate and Œ±-aminoadipate pathways, which employ distinct enzymes and substrates and are found in diverse organisms. Lysine catabolism occurs through one of several pathways, the most common of which is the saccharopine pathway. Lysine plays several roles in humans, most importantly proteinogenesis, but also in the crosslinking of collagen polypeptides, uptake of essential mineral nutrients, and in the production of carnitine, which is key in fatty acid metabolism. Lysine is also often involved in histone modifications, and thus, impacts the epigenome. Lysine is highly concentrated in muscle compared to most other amino acids. Normal lysine metabolism is dependent upon many nutrients including niacin, vitamin B6, riboflavin, vitamin C, glutamic acid and iron. Excess arginine antagonizes lysine. Several inborn errors of lysine metabolism are known, such as cystinuria, hyperdibasic aminoaciduria I, lysinuric protein intolerance, propionic acidemia, and tyrosinemia I. Most are marked by mental retardation with occasional diverse symptoms such as absence of secondary sex characteristics, undescended testes, abnormal facial structure, anemia, obesity, enlarged liver and spleen, and eye muscle imbalance. Lysine also may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of osteoporosis. Although high protein diets result in loss of large amounts of calcium in urine, so does lysine deficiency. Lysine may be an adjunct therapy because it reduces calcium losses in urine. Lysine deficiency also may result in immunodeficiency. Requirements for lysine are probably increased by stress. Lysine toxicity has not occurred with oral doses in humans. Lysine dosages are presently too small and may fail to reach the concentrations necessary to prove potential therapeutic applications. Lysine metabolites, amino caproic acid and carnitine have already shown their therapeutic potential. Thirty grams daily of amino caproic acid has been used as an initial daily dose in treating blood clotting disorders, indicating that the proper doses of lysine, its precursor, have yet to be used in medicine. Low lysine levels have been found in patients with Parkinson's, hypothyroidism, kidney disease, asthma and depression. The exact significance of these levels is unclear, yet lysine therapy can normalize the level and has been associated with improvement of some patients with these conditions. Abnormally elevated hydroxylysines have been found in virtually all chronic degenerative diseases and those treated with coumadin therapy. The levels of this stress marker may be improved by high doses of vitamin C. Lysine is particularly useful in therapy for marasmus (wasting) (http://www.dcnutrition.com). Lysine has also been shown to play a role in anaemia, as lysine is suspected to have an effect on the uptake of iron and, subsequently, the concentration of ferritin in blood plasma.",HMDB0000182_nmroned_1151_28457.txt,nmroned,"l-lysine (s)-2,6-diaminohexanoic acid (s)-alpha,epsilon-diaminocaproic acid (s)-lysine 6-ammonio-l-norleucine k l-2,6-diaminocaproic acid l-lysin lys lysina lysine lysine acid lysinum 2,6-diaminohexanoic acid (s)-2,6-diaminohexanoate (s)-a,epsilon-diaminocaproate (s)-a,epsilon-diaminocaproic acid (s)-alpha,epsilon-diaminocaproate (s)-α,epsilon-diaminocaproate (s)-α,epsilon-diaminocaproic acid l-2,6-diaminocaproate 2,6-diaminohexanoate (+)-s-lysine (s)-2,6-diamino-hexanoate (s)-2,6-diamino-hexanoic acid (s)-a,e-diaminocaproate (s)-a,e-diaminocaproic acid 6-amino-aminutrin 6-amino-l-norleucine a-lysine alpha-lysine aminutrin h-lys-oh l-(+)-lysine l-2,6-diainohexanoate l-2,6-diainohexanoic acid l-lys acetate, lysine enisyl lysine hydrochloride l lysine lysine acetate"

Lactose is also an important osmotic regulator of lactation. It is digested by the intestinal lactase (EC 3.2.1.108), an enzyme expressed in newborns. Its activity declines following weaning. As a result, adult mammals are normally lactose-intolerant and more than 75% of the human adult population suffers from lactase deficiency. Lactase deficiency is present in up to 80 percent of blacks and Latinos, and up to 100 percent of American Indians and Asians. Persons with lactose intolerance are unable to digest significant amounts of lactose. Common symptoms include abdominal pain and bloating, excessive flatus, and watery stool following the ingestion of foods containing lactose. A sizable number of adults believe they are lactose intolerant but do not actually have impaired lactose digestion, and some persons with lactase deficiency can tolerate moderate amounts of ingested lactose. A diagnosis of lactose intolerance can usually be made with a careful history supported by dietary manipulation. If necessary, diagnosis can be confirmed by using a breath hydrogen or lactose tolerance test. These mostly uncomfortable symptoms of lactose maldigestion are blamed for a variably dairy consumption. There is, however, emerging evidence that certain lactic acid-producing bacteria, which selectively consume prebiotics, may be beneficial against some lower intestinal diseases. Lactose maldigestion and lactose should perhaps be re-evaluated as a potential provider of such a prebiotic. Treatment consists primarily of avoiding lactose-containing foods. Lactase enzyme supplements may be helpful. The degree of lactose malabsorption varies greatly among patients with lactose intolerance, but most of them can ingest up to 350 mL of milk daily without symptoms. Lactose-intolerant patients must ensure adequate calcium intake. (PMID: 13130292, 12216958, 12197838, 12018807).

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. L-serine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Serine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as a polar, uncharged (at physiological pH), aliphatic amino acid. In humans, serine is a nonessential amino acid that can be easily derived from glycine. A non-essential amino acid is an amino acid that can be synthesized from central metabolic pathway intermediates in humans and is not required in the diet. Like all the amino acid building blocks of protein and peptides, serine can become essential under certain conditions, and is thus important in maintaining health and preventing disease. L-Serine may be derived from four possible sources: dietary intake; biosynthesis from the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate; from glycine; and by protein and phospholipid degradation. Little data is available on the relative contributions of each of these four sources of l-serine to serine homoeostasis. It is very likely that the predominant source of l-serine will be very different in different tissues and during different stages of human development. In the biosynthetic pathway, the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate is converted into phosphohydroxypyruvate, in a reaction catalyzed by 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3- PGDH; EC 1.1.1.95). Phosphohydroxypyruvate is metabolized to phosphoserine by phosphohydroxypyruvate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.52) and, finally, phosphoserine is converted into l-serine by phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP; EC 3.1.3.3). In liver tissue, the serine biosynthetic pathway is regulated in response to dietary and hormonal changes. Of the three synthetic enzymes, the properties of 3-PGDH and PSP are the best documented. Hormonal factors such as glucagon and corticosteroids also influence 3-PGDH and PSP activities in interactions dependent upon the diet. L-serine is the predominant source of one-carbon groups for the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides and deoxythymidine monophosphate. It has long been recognized that, in cell cultures, L-serine is a conditional essential amino acid, because it cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities to meet the cellular demands for its utilization. In recent years, L-serine and the products of its metabolism have been recognized not only to be essential for cell proliferation, but also to be necessary for specific functions in the central nervous system. The findings of altered levels of serine and glycine in patients with psychiatric disorders and the severe neurological abnormalities in patients with defects of L-serine synthesis underscore the importance of L-serine in brain development and function.

It is a chiral molecule, consisting of two optical isomers, L-lactic acid and D-lactic acid, with the L-isomer being the most common in living organisms. Lactic acid plays a role in several biochemical processes and is produced in the muscles during intense activity. In animals, L-lactate is constantly produced from pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a process of fermentation during normal metabolism and exercise. It does not increase in concentration until the rate of lactate production exceeds the rate of lactate removal. This is governed by a number of factors, including monocarboxylate transporters, lactate concentration, the isoform of LDH, and oxidative capacity of tissues. The concentration of blood lactate is usually 1-2 mmol/L at rest, but can rise to over 20 mmol/L during intense exertion. There are some indications that lactate, and not glucose, is preferentially metabolized by neurons in the brain of several mammalian species, including mice, rats, and humans. Glial cells, using the lactate shuttle, are responsible for transforming glucose into lactate, and for providing lactate to the neurons. Lactate measurement in critically ill patients has been traditionally used to stratify patients with poor outcomes. However, plasma lactate levels are the result of a finely tuned interplay of factors that affect the balance between its production and its clearance. When the oxygen supply does not match its consumption, organisms adapt in many different ways, up to the point when energy failure occurs. Lactate, being part of the adaptive response, may then be used to assess the severity of the supply/demand imbalance. In such a scenario, the time to intervention becomes relevant: early and effective treatment may allow tissues and cells to revert to a normal state, as long as the oxygen machinery (i.e. mitochondria) is intact. Conversely, once the mitochondria are deranged, energy failure occurs even in the presence of normoxia. The lactate increase in critically ill patients may, therefore, be viewed as an early marker of a potentially reversible state (PMID: 16356243). When present in sufficiently high levels, lactic acid can act as an oncometabolite, an immunosuppressant, an acidogen, and a metabotoxin. An oncometabolite is a compound that promotes tumor growth and survival. An immunosuppressant reduces or arrests the activity of the immune system. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of lactic acid are associated with at least a dozen inborn errors of metabolism, including 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, biotinidase deficiency, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase deficiency, glycogen storage disease type 1A (GSD1A) or Von Gierke disease, glycogenosis type IB, glycogenosis type IC, glycogenosis type VI, Hers disease, lactic acidemia, Leigh syndrome, methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, pyruvate decarboxylase E1 component deficiency, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, and short chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCAD deficiency). Locally high concentrations of lactic acid or lactate are found near many tumors due to the upregulation of lactate dehydrogenase (PMID: 15279558). Lactic acid produced by tumors through aerobic glycolysis acts as an immunosuppressant and tumor promoter (PMID: 23729358). Indeed, lactic acid has been found to be a key player or regulator in the development and malignant progression of a variety of cancers (PMID: 22084445). A number of studies have demonstrated that malignant transformation is associated with an increase in aerobic cellular lactate excretion. Lactate concentrations in various carcinomas (e.g. uterine cervix, head and neck, colorectal region) at first diagnosis of the disease, can be relatively low or extremely high (up to 40 µmol/g) in different individual tumors or within the same lesion (PMID: 15279558). High molar concentrations of lactate are correlated with a high incidence of distant metastasis. Low lactate tumors (< median of approximately 8 µmol/g) are associated with both an overall longer and disease-free survival compared to high lactate lesions (lactate > approximately 8 µmol/g). Lactate-induced secretion of hyaluronan by tumor-associated fibroblasts creates a milieu favourable for cell migration and metastases (PMID: 22084445). An acidic environment (pH 6-6.5), which is common in many tumors, allows tumor cells to evade the immune response, and therefore allows them to grow unchecked. Locally high concentrations of lactic acid are known to markedly impede the function of normal immune cells and will lead to a loss of T-cell function of human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (PMID: 22084445). Lactic acid is also an organic acid and acts as a general acidogen. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. Lactic acid is also a microbial metabolite, urinary lactic acid is produced by Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B, Staphylococcus saprophyticus (PMID: 22292465), Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Rhizopus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PMID: 26360870).",HMDB0000190_nmroned_1162_28503.txt,nmroned,"l-lactic acid (+)-lactic acid (s)-(+)-lactic acid (s)-2-hydroxypropanoic acid (s)-2-hydroxypropionic acid l-(+)-alpha-hydroxypropionic acid l-(+)-lactic acid l-milchsaeure l-lactate (+)-lactate (s)-(+)-lactate (s)-2-hydroxypropanoate (s)-2-hydroxypropionate l-(+)-a-hydroxypropionate l-(+)-a-hydroxypropionic acid l-(+)-alpha-hydroxypropionate l-(+)-α-hydroxypropionate l-(+)-α-hydroxypropionic acid l-(+)-lactate (alpha)-lactate (alpha)-lactic acid (s)-(+)-2-hydroxypropanoate (s)-(+)-2-hydroxypropanoic acid (s)-2-hydroxy-propanoate (s)-2-hydroxy-propanoic acid (s)-lactate (s)-lactic acid 1-hydroxyethane 1-carboxylate 1-hydroxyethane 1-carboxylic acid 1-hydroxyethanecarboxylate 1-hydroxyethanecarboxylic acid 2-hydroxypropanoate 2-hydroxypropanoic acid 2-hydroxypropionate a-hydroxypropanoate a-hydroxypropanoic acid a-hydroxypropionate a-hydroxypropionic acid alpha-hydroxypropanoate alpha-hydroxypropanoic acid alpha-hydroxypropionate alpha-hydroxypropionic acid l-(+)- lactic acid l-2-hydroxypropanoate l-2-hydroxypropanoic acid lactate lactic acid milk acid sarcolactic acid 2-hydroxypropionic acid d-lactic acid d lactic acid lactate, ammonium 2 hydroxypropanoic acid 2 hydroxypropionic acid ammonium lactate l lactic acid d-lactate l-lactic acid"

A non-essential amino acid is an amino acid that can be synthesized from central metabolic pathway intermediates in humans and is not required in the diet.  As its name indicates, aspartic acid is the carboxylic acid analog of asparagine. The D-isomer of aspartic acid (D-aspartic acid) is one of two D-amino acids commonly found in mammals. Aspartic acid was first discovered in 1827 by Auguste-Arthur Plisson and √âtienne Ossian Henry by hydrolysis of asparagine, which had been isolated from asparagus juice in 1806. Aspartate has many biochemical roles. It is a neurotransmitter, a metabolite in the urea cycle and it participates in gluconeogenesis. It carries reducing equivalents in the malate-aspartate shuttle, which utilizes the ready interconversion of aspartate and oxaloacetate, which is the oxidized (dehydrogenated) derivative of malic acid. Aspartate donates one nitrogen atom in the biosynthesis of inosine, the precursor to the purine bases which are key to DNA biosynthesis. In addition, aspartic acid acts as a hydrogen acceptor in a chain of ATP synthase. Aspartic acid is a major excitatory neurotransmitter, which is sometimes found to be increased in epileptic and stroke patients. It is decreased in depressed patients and in patients with brain atrophy. As a neurotransmitter, aspartic acid may provide resistance to fatigue and thus lead to endurance, although the evidence to support this idea is not strong (Wikipedia). Aspartic acid supplements are being evaluated. Five grams can raise blood levels. Magnesium and zinc may be natural inhibitors of some of the actions of aspartic acid. Aspartic acid, when chemically coupled with the amino acid D-phenylalanine, is a part of a natural sweetener, aspartame. This sweetener is an advance in artificial sweeteners, and is probably safe in normal doses to all except phenylketonurics. Aspartic acid may be a significant immunostimulant of the thymus and can protect against some of the damaging effects of radiation. Aspartic acid is found in higher abundance in: oysters, luncheon meats, sausage meat, wild game, sprouting seeds, oat flakes, avocado, asparagus, young sugarcane, and molasses from sugar beets.",HMDB0000191_nmroned_1164_28511.txt,nmroned,"l-aspartic acid (s)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (s)-2-aminosuccinic acid 2-aminosuccinic acid asp aspartic acid d l-asparaginsaeure l-asp (s)-2-aminobutanedioate (s)-2-aminosuccinate 2-aminosuccinate aspartate l-aspartate (+)-aspartate (+)-aspartic acid (2s)-aspartate (2s)-aspartic acid (l)-aspartate (l)-aspartic acid (r)-2-aminosuccinate (s)-(+)-aspartate (s)-(+)-aspartic acid (s)-amino-butanedioate (s)-amino-butanedioic acid (s)-aminobutanedioate (s)-aminobutanedioic acid (s)-aspartate (s)-aspartic acid 2-amino-3-methylsuccinate 2-amino-3-methylsuccinic acid alpha-aminosuccinate alpha-aminosuccinic acid aminosuccinate asparagate asparagic acid asparaginate asparaginic acid asparatate h-asp-oh l-(+)-aspartate l-(+)-aspartic acid l-aminosuccinate l-aminosuccinic acid l-asparagate l-asparagic acid l-asparaginate l-asparaginic acid (+-)-aspartic acid (r,s)-aspartic acid aspartate, disodium aspartate, magnesium aspartate, monopotassium aspartic acid, dipotassium salt aspartic acid, hydrobromide aspartic acid, monopotassium salt aspartic acid, monosodium salt aspartic acid, potassium salt l aspartate mg5longoral potassium aspartate polysuccinimide ammonium aspartate aspartate, ammonium aspartate, calcium aspartate, monosodium aspartic acid, calcium salt aspartic acid, disodium salt aspartic acid, magnesium (1:1) salt, hydrochloride, trihydrate dipotassium aspartate disodium aspartate hydrochloride, aspartate magnesium monopotassium aspartate sodium aspartate aspartate, dipotassium aspartic acid, magnesium (2:1) salt aspartic acid, sodium salt hydrobromide aspartic acid magnesium aspartate mg 5 longoral monosodium aspartate aspartate magnesium hydrochloride aspartate, potassium aspartate, sodium aspartic acid, ammonium salt aspartic acid, hydrochloride aspartic acid, magnesium-potassium (2:1:2) salt calcium aspartate hydrochloride aspartic acid l aspartic acid magnesiocard mg-5-longoral poly-dl-succinimide"

These are carboxylic acids containing exactly three carboxyl groups. Isocitric acid is a TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle intermediate. It is a structural isomer of citric acid and is formed from citrate with the help of the enzyme aconitase. More specifically, Isocitric acid is synthesized from citric acid via the intermediate cis-aconitic acid by the enzyme aconitase (aconitate hydratase). Isocitrate is acted upon by isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) to form alpha-ketoglutarate. This is a two-step process, which involves oxidation of isocitrate to oxalosuccinate (a ketone), followed by the decarboxylation of the carboxyl group beta to the ketone, forming alpha-ketoglutarate. In humans, IDH exists in three isoforms: IDH3 catalyzes the third step of the citric acid cycle while converting NAD+ to NADH in the mitochondria. The isoforms IDH1 and IDH2 catalyze the same reaction outside the context of the citric acid cycle and use NADP+ as a cofactor instead of NAD+. They localize to the cytosol as well as the mitochondrion and peroxisome. Isocitric acid exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Isocitric acid is a minor organic acid found in most fruit juices, especially in blackberries, youngberries, and boyberries, and in vegetables, especially in carrots. The determination of D-isocitric acid has become of importance in the analysis of fruit juices for the detection of illegal additives (adulteration). Since the quantities of citric and isocitric acids are correlated in fruit juices, a high ratio of citric to isocitric acid can indicate the addition of citric acid as an alduterant. In authentic orange juice, for example, the ratio of citric acid to D-isocitric acid is usually less than 130. Isocitric acid is mostly used in the food industry (food additive) as a food acidulant.",HMDB0000193_nmroned_1169_28531.txt,nmroned,"isocitric acid 1-hydroxypropane-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid 1-hydroxytricarballylic acid 1-hydroxypropane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate 1-hydroxytricarballylate isocitrate 1-hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylate 1-hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid 3-carboxy-2,3-dideoxy-1-hydroxypropan-1,2,3-tricarboxylate 3-carboxy-2,3-dideoxy-1-hydroxypropan-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid 3-carboxy-2,3-dideoxy-pentarate 3-carboxy-2,3-dideoxy-pentaric acid d-isocitrate i-cit threo-d(s)-iso-citrate threo-ds-isocitrate isocitric acid, sodium salt isocitric acid, trisodium salt isocitric acid, disodium salt isocitric acid, (11)c-labeled isocitric acid, calcium salt isocitric acid, potassium salt"

It is a derivative of carnosine, which had been methylated. The methyl group of anserine is added to carnosine by the enzyme S-adenosylmethionine: carnosine N-methyltransferase (PMID: 29484990). The enzyme is closely related to histamine N-methyltransferase and appears to be present in a majority of anserine-producing species (PMID: 23705015). Anserine is a generally a more metabolically stable derivative of carnosine. Anserine can be found in the skeletal muscle and brain of certain mammals (rabbits, cattle), migratory fish and birds. This dipeptide is normally absent from human tissues and body fluids, and its appearance there is usually an artifact of diet. Anserine can also arise from serum carnosinase deficiency. (OMIM 212200). Anserine was first discovered in goose muscle in 1929, and was named after this extraction (anser is Latin for goose). Anserine, which is water-soluble, is found at high levels in the muscles of different non-human vertebrates, with poultry, rabbit, tuna, plaice, and salmon having generally higher contents than other marine foods, beef, or pork (PMID: 31908682). An increase of urinary anserine excretion has been found in humans after the consumption of chicken, rabbit, and tuna and has been associated with intake of chicken, salmon, and, to a lesser extent, beef (PMID: 31908682).  Anserine can undergo cleavage to give rise to 3-methylhistidine.(3-MH). The dipeptide balenine, common in some whales, cleaves to form 1-methylhistidine (1-MH) (PMID: 31908682).  There is considerable confusion with regard to the nomenclature of the methylated nitrogen atoms on the imidazole ring of histidine and other histidine-containing peptides such as anserine. In particular, older literature (mostly prior to the year 2000) designated anserine (N-pi methylated) as beta-alanyl-N1-methyl-histidine, whereas according to standard IUPAC nomenclature, anserine is correctly named as beta-alanyl-N3-methyl-histidine. As a result, many papers published prior to the year 2000 incorrectly identified 1MH as a specific marker for dietary consumption of certain foods or various pathophysiological effects when they really were referring to 3MH or vice versa (PMID: 24137022). In particular balenine (a whale or snake-specific dipeptide with 1MH) was often confused with anserine (the poultry dipeptide with 3MH). An animal model study of Alzheimer's disease using mice found that treatment with anserine reduced memory loss (PMID: 28974740). Anserine reduced glial inflammatory activity (particularly of astrocyte). The study also found that anserine-treated mice had greater pericyte surface area. The greater area of pericytes was commensurate with improved memory. The anserine-treated mice overall performed better on a spatial memory test (Morris Water Maze) (PMID: 28974740). A human study on 84 elderly subjects showed that subjects who took anserine and carnosine supplements for one year showed increased blood flow in the prefrontal cortex on MRI (PMID: 29896423).",HMDB0000194_nmroned_1171_28541.txt,nmroned,anserine beta-alanyl-3-methyl-l-histidine beta-alanyl-n(pai)-methyl-l-histidine b-alanyl-3-methyl-l-histidine β-alanyl-3-methyl-l-histidine b-alanyl-n(pai)-methyl-l-histidine β-alanyl-n(pai)-methyl-l-histidine l-anserine l-n-b-alanyl-3-methyl-histidine l-n-beta-alanyl-3-methyl-histidine n-b-alanyl-3-methyl-l-histidine n-beta-alanyl-3-methyl-l-histidine balanine beta alanyl 3 methylhistidine beta-alanyl-3-methylhistidine ophidine

Purine nucleosides are compounds comprising a purine base attached to a ribosyl or deoxyribosyl moiety. Inosine is formed when hypoxanthine is attached to a ribose ring a beta-N9-glycosidic bond. Inosine is an intermediate in the degradation of purines and purine nucleosides to uric acid. Inosine is also an intermediate in the purine salvage pathway. Inosine occurs in the anticodon of certain transfer RNA molecules and is essential for proper translation of the genetic code in wobble base pairs. Inosine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Inosine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, inosine can be biosynthesized from inosinic acid through its interaction with the enzyme known as cytosolic purine 5'-nucleotidase. In addition, inosine can be converted into hypoxanthine and ribose 1-phosphate through its interaction with the enzyme known as purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Altered levels of inosine have also been associated with purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency and xanthinuria type I, both of which are inborn errors of metabolism. Animal studies have suggested that inosine has neuroprotective properties. It has been proposed as a potential treatment for spinal cord injury (PMID: 16317421) and for administration after stroke, as inosine appears to induce axonal rewiring (PMID: 12084941). After ingestion, inosine is metabolized into uric acid, which has been found to be a natural antioxidant and peroxynitrite scavenger. As such, inosine may have potential benefits to patients with multiple sclerosis and Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PMID: 19425822). Inosine can also be produced by gut bacteria and appears to have a number of beneficial effects.  Inosine, has been shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma signaling in human colon epithelial cells. Furthermore, exogenous treatment of inosine has been found to protect against DSS-induced colitis in rodents by improving adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR)/PPAR-gamma-dependent mucosal barrier functions (PMID: 33820558). Microbiome-derived inosine has also been shown to modulate the response to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in cancer models. In particular, decreased gut barrier function induced by immunotherapy increases systemic translocation of bacterially derived inosine and activates antitumor T cells. The effect of inosine is dependent on T cell expression of the adenosine A2A receptor and requires co-stimulation. Inosine appears to have other roles in non-mammalian system.

breakdown product of tryptophan metabolism and is often produced by the action of bacteria in the mammalian gut. Higher levels of IAA are associated with bacteria from Clostridium species including C. stricklandii, C. lituseburense, C. subterminale, and C. putrefaciens (PMID: 12173102). IAA can be found in Agrobacterium, Azospirillum, Bacillus, Bradyrhizobium, Clostridium, Enterobacter, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium (PMID: 12173102, PMID: 17555270, PMID: 12147474, PMID: 19400643, PMID: 9450337, PMID: 21397014) (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-3084-7_7) (https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1bf1b5m3). Some endogenous production of IAA in mammalian tissues also occurs. It may be produced by the decarboxylation of tryptamine or the oxidative deamination of tryptophan. IAA frequently occurs at low levels in urine and has been found in elevated levels in the urine of patients with phenylketonuria (PMID: 13610897). IAA has also been identified as a uremic toxin according to the European Uremic Toxin Working Group (PMID: 22626821). Using material extracted from human urine, it was discovered by Kogl in 1933 that indoleacetic acid is also an important plant hormone (PMID: 13610897). Specifically, IAA is a member of the group of phytohormones called auxins. IAA is generally considered to be the most important native auxin. Plant cells synthesize IAA from tryptophan (Wikipedia). IAA and some derivatives can be oxidized by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into cytotoxic species. IAA is only toxic after oxidative decarboxylation; the effect of IAA/HRP is thought to be due in part to the formation of methylene-oxindole, which may conjugate with DNA bases and protein thiols. IAA/HRP could be used as the basis for targeted cancer, a potential new role for plant auxins in cancer therapy (PMID: 11163327).",HMDB0000197_nmroned_1176_28562.txt,nmroned,"indoleacetic acid

Acetylcarnitine is an endogenous compound widely distributed in many tissues, including brain. Chemically, acetylcarnitine is the acetylated derivative of the amino acid L-carnitine whose function is generally correlated with regulation of energy metabolism within mitochondria. The synthesis of acetylcarnitine is catalyzed by the enzyme carnitine acetyltransferase (CAT), which is located on the inner mitochondrial membrane as well as in endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisome. CAT promotes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-Coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) to carnitine, thereby producing acetylcarnitine and free CoA (PMID: 29267192). After being synthetized, acetylcarnitine is transported outside mitochondria into the cytosol by the enzyme carnitine/acetylcarnitine translocase (CACT). This is a crucial metabolic reaction for beta-oxidation of fatty acids whereby acetylcarnitine facilitates the transport of acetyl-CoA across mitochondrial membranes (PMID: 29267192).  In addition to his metabolic role, L-acetylcarnitine possesses unique neuroprotective, neuromodulatory, and neurotrophic properties. acetylcarnitine is mobile throughout the plasma membranes and can rapidly cross blood-brain barrier. Indeed, acetylcarnitine can be transported by the high-affinity sodium-dependent organic cation/transporter (OCTN2), which is functionally expressed in cells forming the blood-brain barrier (PMID: 29267192). A wide range of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the multiplicity of acetylcarnitine activities within nervous tissues. In particular, it has been demonstrated that acetylcarnitine modulates the activity of nerve growth factor (NGF) and enhances the expression of NGF receptors in striatum/hippocampus during development (PMID: 29267192).  Moreover, acetylcarnitine modulates different neurotransmitter systems, including the GABAergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic system by increasing acetyl-CoA content and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity. This may play an important role in counteracting various neurodegenerative disease processes (PMID: 15363640).

In particular, the coenzyme A-linked form of methylmalonic acid, methylmalonyl-CoA, is converted into succinyl-CoA by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in a reaction that requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor. In this way, methylmalonic acid enters the Krebs cycle and is thus part of one of the anaplerotic reactions. Abnormalities in methylmalonic acid metabolism lead to methylmalonic aciduria. This inborn error of metabolism is attributed to a block in the enzymatic conversion of methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA. Methylmalonic acid is also found to be associated with other inborn errors of metabolism, including cobalamin deficiency, cobalamin malabsorption, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency, and transcobalamin II deficiency. When present in sufficiently high levels, methylmalonic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of methylmalonic acid are associated with at least 5 inborn errors of metabolism, including Malonyl CoA decarboxylase deficiency, Malonic Aciduria, Methylmalonate Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency, Methylmalonic Aciduria and Methylmalonic Aciduria Due to Cobalamin-Related Disorders. Methylmalonic acid is an organic acid and abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development.

It has a slight honey-like odor. Levels of phenylpyruvate are normally very low in blood or urine. High levels of phenylpyruvic acid can be found in the urine of individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), an inborn error of metabolism. PKU is due to lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), so that phenylalanine is converted not to tyrosine but to phenylpyruvic acid. In particular, excessive phenylalanine can be metabolized into phenylketones through, a transaminase pathway route involving glutamate. Metabolites of this transamination reaction include phenylacetate, phenylpyruvate and phenethylamine. In persons with PKU, dietary phenylalanine either accumulates in the body or some of it is converted to phenylpyruvic acid. Individuals with PKU tend to excrete large quantities of phenylpyruvate, phenylacetate and phenyllactate, along with phenylalanine, in their urine. If untreated, mental retardation effects and microcephaly are evident by the first year along with other symptoms which include: unusual irritability, epileptic seizures and skin lesions. Hyperactivity, EEG abnormalities and seizures, and severe learning disabilities are major clinical problems later in life. A ""musty or mousy"" odor of skin, hair, sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate accumulation); and a tendency to hypopigmentation and eczema are also observed. The neural-development effects of PKU are primarily due to the disruption of neurotransmitter synthesis. In particular, phenylalanine is a large, neutral amino acid which moves across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via the large neutral amino acid transporter (LNAAT). Excessive phenylalanine in the blood saturates the transporter. Thus, excessive levels of phenylalanine significantly decrease the levels of other LNAAs in the brain. But since these amino acids are required for protein and neurotransmitter synthesis, phenylalanine accumulation disrupts brain development, leading to mental retardation.

N-acyl-alpha amino acids are compounds containing an alpha amino acid which bears an acyl group at one of its nitrogen atoms. N-epsilon-Acetyl-L-lysine can also be classified as an alpha amino acid or a derivatized alpha amino acid. Technically, N-epsilon-Acetyl-L-lysine is a biologically available sidechain, N-capped form of the proteinogenic alpha amino acid L-lysine. Unlike L-lysine, acetylated lysine derivatives such as N-epsilon-Acetyl-L-lysine are zwitterionic compounds. These are molecules that contains an equal number of positively- and negatively-charged functional groups. N-epsilon-Acetyl-L-lysine is found naturally in eukaryotes ranging from yeast to plants to humans.  N-acetyl amino acids can be produced either via direct synthesis of specific N-acetyltransferases or via the proteolytic degradation of N-acetylated proteins (often histones) by specific hydrolases. N-epsilon-Acetyl-L-lysine can be biosynthesized from L-lysine and acetyl-CoA via the enzyme known as Lysine N-acetyltransferase. Post-translational lysine-acetylation is one of two major modifications of lysine residues in various proteins ‚Äì either N-terminal or N-alpha acetylation or N6 (sidechain) acetylation. Side-chain acetylation of specific lysine residues in the N-terminal domains of core histones is a biochemical marker of active genes. Acetylation is now known to play a major role in eukaryotic transcription. Specifically, acetyltransferase enzymes that act on particular lysine side chains of histones and other proteins are intimately involved in transcriptional activation. By modifying chromatin proteins and transcription-related factors, these acetylases are believed to regulate the transcription of many genes. The best-characterized mechanism is acetylation, catalyzed by histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes. HATs function enzymatically by transferring an acetyl group from acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) to the amino group of certain lysine side chains within a histone's basic N-terminal tail region. Within a histone octamer, these regions extend out from the associated globular domains, and in the context of a nucleosome, they are believed to bind the DNA through charge interactions (positively charged histone tails associated with negatively charged DNA) or mediate interactions between nucleosomes. Lysine acetylation, which neutralizes part of a tail region's positive charge, is postulated to weaken histone-DNA or nucleosome-nucleosome interactions and/or signal a conformational change, thereby destabilizing nucleosome structure or arrangement and giving other nuclear factors, such as the transcription complex, more access to a genetic locus. In agreement with this is the fact that acetylated chromatin has long been associated with states of transcriptional activation. Specific recognition of N6-acetyl-L-lysine is a conserved function of all bromodomains found in different proteins, recognized as an emerging intracellular signalling mechanism that plays critical roles in regulating gene transcription, cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, DNA repair, and cytoskeletal organization (PMID: 9169194 , 10827952 , 17340003 , 16247734 , 9478947 , 10839822 ). N-acetylated amino acids, such as N-epsilon-Acetyl-L-lysine can be released by an N-acylpeptide hydrolase from histones going through proteolytic degradation (PMID: 16465618). Many N-acetylamino acids are classified as uremic toxins if present in high abundance in the serum or plasma (PMID: 26317986; PMID: 20613759). Uremic toxins are a diverse group of endogenously produced molecules that, if not properly cleared or eliminated by the kidneys, can cause kidney damage, cardiovascular disease and neurological deficits (PMID: 18287557).",HMDB0000206_nmroned_1188_28614.txt,nmroned,n6-acetyl-l-lysine (2s)-6-(acetylamino)-2-aminohexanoic acid n(6)-acetyllysine n(zeta)-acetyllysine n-epsilon-acetyl-l-lysine n-epsilon-acetyllysine n(epsilon)-acetyl-l-lysine n(zeta)-acetyl-l-lysine (2s)-6-(acetylamino)-2-aminohexanoate n(z)-acetyllysine n(ζ)-acetyllysine n(z)-acetyl-l-lysine n(ζ)-acetyl-l-lysine e-acetyl-l-lysine e-n-acetyl-l-lysine e-n-acetyllysine epsilon-acetyl-l-lysine epsilon-n-acetyl-l-lysine epsilon-n-acetyllysine l-e-n-acetyllysine l-epsilon-n-acetyllysine n-e-acetyl-l-lysine n-e-acetyllysine n6-acetyllysine ne-acetyl-l-lysine ne-acetyllysine omega-n-acetyl-l-lysine w-n-acetyl-l-lysine n(6)-acetyllsine omega-acetyllsine (2s)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid 6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid l-ε-n-acetyllysine nepsilon-acetyl-l-lysine nepsilon-acetyllysine nε-acetyl-l-lysine nε-acetyllysine ε-acetyl-l-lysine ε-n-acetyl-l-lysine ε-n-acetyllysine ω-n-acetyl-l-lysine n6-acetyl-l-lysine

The name derives from the Latin word oleum, which means oil. Oleic acid is the most abundant fatty acid in human adipose tissue, and the second most abundant in human tissues overall, following palmitic acid. Oleic acid is a component of the normal human diet, being a part of animal fats and vegetable oils. Triglycerides of oleic acid represent the majority of olive oil (about 70%). Oleic acid triglycerides also make up 59‚Äì75% of pecan oil, 61% of canola oil, 36‚Äì67% of peanut oil, 60% of macadamia oil, 20‚Äì80% of sunflower oil, 15‚Äì20% of grape seed oil, sea buckthorn oil, 40% of sesame oil, and 14% of poppyseed oil. High oleic variants of plant sources such as sunflower (~80%) and canola oil (70%) also have been developed. consumption has been associated with decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and possibly with increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, however, the ability of oleic acid to raise HDL is still debated. Oleic acid may be responsible for the hypotensive (blood pressure reducing) effects of olive oil that is considered a health benefit. Oleic acid is used in manufacturing of surfactants, soaps, plasticizers. It is also used as an emulsifying agent in foods and pharmaceuticals.

In the TCA cycle, AKG is decarboxylated to succinyl-CoA and carbon dioxide by AKG dehydrogenase, which functions as a key control point of the TCA cycle. Additionally, AKG can be generated from isocitrate by oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by the enzyme known as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). In addition to these routes of production, AKG can be produced from glutamate by oxidative deamination via glutamate dehydrogenase, and as a product of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transamination reactions (mediated by branched-chain amino acid transaminases) in which glutamate is a common amino donor. AKG is a nitrogen scavenger and a source of glutamate and glutamine that stimulates protein synthesis and inhibits protein degradation in muscles. In particular, AKG can decrease protein catabolism and increase protein synthesis to enhance bone tissue formation in skeletal muscles (PMID: 26759695). Interestingly, enteric feeding of AKG supplements can significantly increase circulating plasma levels of hormones such as insulin, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (PMID: 26759695). It has recently been shown that AKG can extend the lifespan of adult C. elegans by inhibiting ATP synthase and TOR (PMID: 24828042). In combination with molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate is required for the hydroxylation of proline to hydroxyproline in the production of type I collagen. A recent study has shown that alpha-ketoglutarate promotes TH1 differentiation along with the depletion of glutamine thereby favouring Treg (regulatory T-cell) differentiation (PMID: 26420908). alpha-Ketoglutarate has been found to be associated with fumarase deficiency, 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, and D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which are all inborn errors of metabolism (PMID: 8338207).

Inositol is a derivative of cyclohexane with six hydroxyl groups, making it a polyol. It also is known as a sugar alcohol, having exactly the same molecular formula as glucose or other hexoses. Inositol exists in nine possible stereoisomers, of which cis-1,2,3,5-trans-4,6-cyclohexanehexol, or myo-inositol is the most widely occurring form in nature. The other known inositols include scyllo-inositol, muco-inositol, D-chiro-inositol, L-chiro-inositol, neo-inositol, allo-inositol, epi-inositol and cis-inositol. myo-Inositol is found naturally in many foods (particularly in cereals with high bran content) and can be used as a sweetner as it has half the sweetness of sucrose (table sugar). myo-Inositol was once considered a member of the vitamin B complex and given the name: vitamin B8. However, because it is produced by the human body from glucose, it is not an essential nutrient, and therefore cannot be called a vitamin. myo-Inositol is a precursor molecule for a number of secondary messengers including various inositol phosphates. In addition, inositol/myo-inositol is an important component of the lipids known as phosphatidylinositol (PI) phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP). myo-Inositol is synthesized from glucose, via glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) in two steps. First, G-6-P is isomerised by an inositol-3-phosphate synthase enzyme to myo-inositol 1-phosphate, which is then dephosphorylated by an inositol monophosphatase enzyme to give free myo-inositol. In humans, myo-inositol is primarily synthesized in the kidneys at a rate of a few grams per day. myo-Inositol can be used in the management of preterm babies who have or are at a risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome. It is also used as a treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It works by increasing insulin sensitivity, which helps to improve ovarian function and reduce hyperandrogenism.

L-alpha-amino acids are alpha amino acids which have the L-configuration of the alpha-carbon atom. L-ornithine is soluble (in water) and a moderately basic compound. Ornithine is a non-proteinogenic amino acid that plays a role in the urea cycle. It is considered to be a non-essential amino acid. A non-essential amino acid is an amino acid that can be synthesized from central metabolic pathway intermediates in humans and is not required in the diet. L-Ornithine is one of the products of the action of the enzyme arginase on L-arginine, creating urea. Therefore, ornithine is a central part of the urea cycle, which allows for the disposal of excess nitrogen. Outside the human body, L-ornithine is abundant in a number of food items such as wild rice, brazil nuts, common oregano, and common grapes. L-ornithine can be found throughout most human tissues; and in most biofluids, some of which include blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), sweat, saliva, and feces. L-ornithine exists in all living species, from bacteria to plants to humans. L-Ornithine is also a precursor of citrulline and arginine. In order for ornithine that is produced in the cytosol to be converted to citrulline, it must first cross the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix where it is carbamylated by the enzyme known as ornithine transcarbamylase. This transfer is mediated by the mitochondrial ornithine transporter (SLC25A15; AF112968; ORNT1). Mutations in the mitochondrial ornithine transporter result in hyperammonemia, hyperornithinemia, homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome, a disorder of the urea cycle (PMID: 16256388). The pathophysiology of the disease may involve diminished ornithine transport into mitochondria, resulting in ornithine accumulation in the cytoplasm and reduced ability to clear carbamoyl phosphate and ammonia loads (OMIM 838970). In humans, L-ornithine is involved in a number of other metabolic disorders, some of which include, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC deficiency), argininemia, and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency (GAMT deficiency). Ornithine is abnormally accumulated in the body in ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Moreover, Ornithine is found to be associated with cystinuria, hyperdibasic aminoaciduria I, and lysinuric protein intolerance, which are inborn errors of metabolism.

Palmitic acid is the first fatty acid produced during fatty acid synthesis and is the precursor to longer fatty acids. As a consequence, palmitic acid is a major body component of animals. In humans, one analysis found it to make up 21–30% (molar) of human depot fat (PMID: 13756126), and it is a major, but highly variable, lipid component of human breast milk (PMID: 352132). Palmitic acid is used to produce soaps, cosmetics, and industrial mould release agents. These applications use sodium palmitate, which is commonly obtained by saponification of palm oil. To this end, palm oil, rendered from palm tree (species Elaeis guineensis), is treated with sodium hydroxide (in the form of caustic soda or lye), which causes hydrolysis of the ester groups, yielding glycerol and sodium palmitate. Aluminium salts of palmitic acid and naphthenic acid were combined during World War II to produce napalm. The word ""napalm"" is derived from the words naphthenic acid and palmitic acid (Wikipedia).

It is technically a long-chain acyl fatty acid derivative ester of carnitine which facilitates the transfer of long-chain fatty acids from cytoplasm into mitochondria during the oxidation of fatty acids. The general role of acylcarnitines is to transport acyl-groups, organic acids and fatty acids, from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria so that they can be broken down to produce energy. As part of this process, palmitic acid is first transported into the cell via the long-chain fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1). Once inside the cell it undergoes a reaction to form an acyl-CoA derivative called palmitoyl-CoA. This reaction is facilitated by the Long-chain fatty-acid CoA ligase 1 protein, which adds a CoA moiety to appropriate acyl groups. Many acyl-CoA groups will then further react with other zwitterionic compounds such as carnitine (to form acylcarnitines) and amino acids (to form acyl amides). The carnitine needed to form acylcarnitines inside the cell is transported into the cell by the organic cation/carnitine transporter 2.  In forming an acylcarnitine derivative, palmitoyl-CoA reacts with L-carnitine to form palmitoylcarnitine. This reaction is catalyzed by carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase. This enzyme resides in the mitochondrial outer membrane. While this reaction takes place, the palmitoylcarnitine is moved into the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Following the reaction, the newly synthesized acylcarnitine is transported into the mitochondrial matrix by a mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier protein found in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Once in the matrix, palmitoylcarnitine can react with the carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 2 enzyme found in the mitochondrial inner membrane to once again form palmitoyl-CoA and L-carnitine. Palmitoyl-CoA then enters into the mitochondrial beta-oxidation pathway to form aceytl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA can go on to enter the TCA cycle, or it can react with L-carnitine to form L-acetylcarnitine in a reaction catalyzed by Carnitine O-acetyltransferase. This reaction can occur in both directions, and L-acetylcarnitine and CoA can react to form acetyl-CoA and L-carnitine in certain circumstances. Finally, acetyl-CoA in the cytosol can be catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 to form malonyl-CoA, which inhibits the action of carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1, thereby preventing palmitoylcarnitine from forming and thereby preventing it from being transported into the mitochondria.  L-Palmitoylcarnitine has been also reported to change the activity of certain proteins and to stimulate the activity of caspases 3, 7, and 8. Interestingly, the level of this long-chain acylcarnitine has been shown to increase during apoptosis. Palmitoylcarnitine has also been reported to diminish the binding of phorbol esters (protein kinase C activators) and the autophosphorylation of the enzyme. Some of the physicochemical properties of palmitoylcarnitine may help to explain the need for coenzyme A-carnitine-coenzyme A acyl exchange during mitochondrial fatty acid import. The amphiphilic character of palmitoylcarnitine may also explain its proposed involvement in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia. L-Palmitoylcarnitine accumulates in ischemic myocardium and potentially contributes to myocardial damage through alterations in membrane molecular dynamics. This is a mechanism through which could play an important role in ischemic injury (PMID: 2540838, 15363641, 8706815). Palmitoylcarnitine is characteristically elevated in late-onset carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency (OMIM: 255110).

It takes part in gluconeogenesis, the urea cycle, the glyoxylate cycle, amino acid synthesis, fatty acid synthesis and the citric acid cycle. Oxalacetic acid exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Within humans, oxalacetic acid participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, oxalacetic acid is an intermediate of the citric acid cycle, where it reacts with acetyl-CoA to form citrate, catalyzed by citrate synthase. It is also involved in gluconeogenesis and the urea cycle. In gluconeogenesis oxaloacetate is decarboxylated and phosphorylated by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and becomes 2-phosphoenolpyruvate using guanosine triphosphate (GTP) as phosphate source. In the urea cycle, malate is acted on by malate dehydrogenase to become oxaloacetate, producing a molecule of NADH. After that, oxaloacetate can be recycled to aspartate, as this recycling maintains the flow of nitrogen into the cell. In mice, injections of oxalacetic acid have been shown to promote brain mitochondrial biogenesis, activate the insulin signaling pathway, reduce neuroinflammation and activate hippocampal neurogenesis (PMID: 25027327). Oxalacetic acid has also been reported to reduce hyperglycemia in type II diabetes and to extend longevity in C. elegans (PMID: 25027327). Outside of the human body, oxalacetic acid has been detected, but not quantified in, several different foods, such as Persian limes, lemon balms, wild rice, canola, and peanuts.

Phosphoethanolamines are compounds containing a phosphate linked to the second carbon of an ethanolamine. O-Phosphoethanolamine is used in the biosynthesis of two different types of phospholipids: glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. O-Phosphoethanolamine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Within humans, O-phosphoethanolamine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, cytidine triphosphate and O-phosphoethanolamine can be converted into CDP-ethanolamine; which is mediated by the enzyme ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase. In addition, O-phosphoethanolamine can be biosynthesized from ethanolamine; which is catalyzed by the enzyme choline/ethanolamine kinase. In humans, O-phosphoethanolamine is involved in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. O-phosphoethanolamine is also a product of the metabolism of sphingolipids. In particular, sphinglipids are metabolized in vivo to phosphorylethanolamine and a fatty aldehyde, generally palmitaldehyde. Both metabolites are ultimately converted to glycerophospholipids. The lipids are first phosphorylated by a kinase and then cleaved by the pyridoxal-dependent sphinganine-1-phosphate aldolase. Elevated urine levels of O-Phosphoethanolamine or PEA can be used to help in the diagnosis of Hypophosphatasia (HPP). Reference ranges for urinary PEA vary according to age and somewhat by diet, and follow a circadian rhythm.

That is it is a uracil bearing a carboxy substituent at position C-6. It is also classified as a pyrimidinedione and a carboxylic acid. Orotic acid is a minor dietary constituent. Indeed, until it was realized that it could be synthesized by humans, orotic acid was known as vitamin B-13. The richest dietary sources of orotic acid are cow's milk and other dairy products as well as root vegetables such as carrots and beets. Dietary intake probably contributes to a basal rate of orotic acid excretion in urine because fasting decreases excretion by ~50%. However, it is now apparent that most urinary orotic acid is synthesized in the body, where it arises as an intermediate in the pathway for the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. Orotic acid is converted to UMP by UMP synthase, a multifunctional protein with both orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidylate decarboxylase activity. The most frequently observed inborn error of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis is a mutation of the multifunctional protein UMP synthase (UMP synthase deficiency or orotic aciduria). This disorder prevents the conversion of orotic acid to UMP, and thus to other pyrimidines. As a result, plasma orotic acid accumulates to high concentrations, and increased quantities appear in the urine. Indeed, urinary orotic acid is so markedly increased in individuals harboring a mutation in UMP synthase that orotic acid crystals can form in the urine. The urinary concentration of orotic acid in individuals suffering from orotic aciduria can be of the order of millimoles of orotic acid per millimole creatinine. By comparison, the urinary level in unaffected individuals is ~ 1 ¬¨umol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 17513443). Orotic aciduria is characterized by megaloblastic anemia and orotic acid crystalluria that is frequently associated with some degree of physical and mental retardation. These features respond to appropriate pyrimidine replacement therapy and most cases appear to have a good prognosis. When present in sufficiently high levels, orotic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of orotic acid are associated with at least seven inborn errors of metabolism, including argininemia, LPI syndrome (lysinuric protein intolerance), hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH), OTC deficiency, citrullinemia type I, purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency, and orotic aciduria. Orotic acid is broadly classified as an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures.",HMDB0000226_nmroned_1238_28820.txt,nmroned,"orotic acid orotsaeure uracil-6-carboxylic acid uracil-6-carboxylate orotate 1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-2,6-dioxo-4-pyrimidecarboxylic acid 1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-2,6-dioxo-4-pyrimidinecarboxylic acid 1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-2,6-dioxopyrimidin-4-carbonsaeure 2,6-dihydroxy-4-pyrimidinecarboxylic acid 2,6-dihydroxypyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid 2,6-dioxo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid 2,6-dioxo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid 6-carboxy-2,4-dihydroxypyrimidine 6-carboxyuracil 6-uracilcarboxylic acid acide orotique acido orotico acidum oroticum animal galactose factor lactinium molkensaeure oro orodin oropur orotonin orotonsan orotsaure oroturic orotyl uracil-6-carbosaeure vitamin b13 whey factor zinc orotate orotate, zinc acid, orotic orotate, potassium potassium orotate orotate, sodium sodium orotate"

These are fatty acids in which the chain bears a hydroxyl group. Mevalonic acid is a key organic compound in biochemistry. It is found in most higher organisms ranging from plants to animals. Mevalonic acid is a precursor in the biosynthetic pathway known as the mevalonate pathway that produces terpenes (in plants) and steroids (in animals). Mevalonic acid is the primary precursor of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), that is in turn the basis for all terpenoids. The production of mevalonic acid by the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, is the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol (PMID: 12872277). The cholesterol biosynthetic pathway has three major steps: (1) acetate to mevalonate, (2) mevalonate to squalene, and (3) squalene to cholesterol. In the first step, which catalyzed by thiolase, two acetyl-CoA molecules form acetoacetyl-CoA and one CoA molecule is released, then the acetoacetyl-CoA reacts with another molecule of acetyl-CoA and generates 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMGCoA). The enzyme responsible for this reaction is 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMG-CoA synthase): In the pathway to synthesize cholesterol, one of the HMG-CoA carboxyl groups undergoes reduction to an alcohol, releasing CoA, leading to the formation of mevalonate, a six carbon compound. This reaction is catalyzed by hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, In the second step (mevalonate to squalene) mevalonate receives a phosphoryl group from ATP to form 5-phosphomevalonate. This compound accepts another phosphate to generate mevalonate-5-pyrophosphate. After a third phosphorylation, the compound is decarboxylated, loses water, and generates isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). Then through successive condensations, IPP forms squalene, a terpene hydrocarbon that contains 30 carbon atoms. By cyclization and other changes, this compound will finally result in cholesterol. Mevalonic acid is found, on average, in the highest concentration within a few different foods, such as apples, corns, and wild carrots and in a lower concentration in garden tomato (var.), pepper (C. frutescens), and cucumbers. Mevalonic acid has also been detected, but not quantified in, several different foods, such as sweet oranges, potato, milk (cow), cabbages, and white cabbages. This could make mevalonic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of these foods.

It occurs in many glycoproteins, glycolipids, and polysaccharides in both mammals and bacteria. The most abundant sialic acid, NeuAc, is synthesized in vivo from N-acetylated D-mannosamine (ManNAc) or D-glucosamine (GlcNAc). NeuAc and its activated form, CMP-NeuAc, are biosynthesized in five consecutive reactions that form the intermediates UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc), ManNAc 6-phosphate, NeuAc 9-phosphate, and CMP-NeuAc. CMP-NeuAc is transported into the Golgi apparatus and, with the aid of specific sialyltransferases, added onto nonreducing positions on oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids. NeuAc is widely distributed throughout human tissues and found in several fluids, including serum, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, urine, amniotic fluid, and breast milk. It is found in high levels in the brain, adrenal glands, and the heart. Serum and urine levels of the free acid are elevated in individuals suffering from renal failure. Serum and saliva Neu5Ac levels are also elevated in alcoholics. A genetic disorder known as Salla disease or infantile NeuAc storage disease is also characterized by high serum and urine levels of this compound. The negative charge is responsible for the slippery feel of saliva and mucins coating the body's organs. This particular sialic acid is known to act as a ""decoy"""" for invading pathogens. Along with involvement in preventing infections (mucus associated with mucous membranes — mouth, nose, GI, respiratory tract), Neu5Ac acts as a receptor for influenza viruses, allowing attachment to mucous cells via hemagglutinin (an early step in acquiring influenzavirus infection). NeuAc is also becoming known as an agent necessary for mediating ganglioside distribution and structures in the brain. Sialic acid (SA) is an N-acetylated derivative of neuraminic acid that is an abundant terminal monosaccharide of glycoconjugates. Normal human serum SA is largely bound to glycoproteins or glycolipids (total sialic acid (TSA): 1.5-2.5 mmol/L), with small amounts of free SA (1-3 umol/L). Negatively charged SA units stabilize glycoprotein conformation in cell surface receptors to increase cell rigidity. This enables signal recognition and adhesion to ligands, antibodies, enzymes, and microbes. SA residues are antigenic determinant residues in carbohydrate chains of glycolipids and glycoproteins, chemical messengers in tissue and body fluids, and may regulate glomeruli basement membrane permeability. Sialic acids are structurally unique nine-carbon keto sugars occupying the interface between the host and commensal or pathogenic microorganisms. An important function of host sialic acid is to regulate innate immunity. Sialic acid is the moiety most actively recycled for metabolic purposes in the salvage pathways in glycosphingolipid metabolism. Sialic acid is indispensable for the neuritogenic activities of ganglioside constituents which are unique in that a sialic acid directly binds to the glucose of the cerebroside, they are mutually connected in tandem, and some are located in the internal parts of the sugar chain. Sialylation (sialic acid linked to galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, or another sialic acid) represents one of the most frequently occurring terminations of the oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids. The biosynthesis of the various linkages is mediated by the different members of the sialyltransferase family (PMID: 11425186, 11287396, 12770781, 16624269, 12510390, 15007099).",HMDB0000230_nmroned_1247_28856.txt,nmroned,"n-acetylneuraminic acid 5-n-acetyl-beta-d-neuraminic acid beta-neu5ac 5-n-acetyl-b-d-neuraminate 5-n-acetyl-b-d-neuraminic acid 5-n-acetyl-beta-d-neuraminate 5-n-acetyl-β-d-neuraminate 5-n-acetyl-β-d-neuraminic acid b-neu5ac β-neu5ac n-acetylneuraminate 5-(acetylamino)-3,5-dideoxy-d-glycero-b-d-galacto-2-nonulopyranosonate 5-(acetylamino)-3,5-dideoxy-d-glycero-b-d-galacto-2-nonulopyranosonic acid 5-(acetylamino)-3,5-dideoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-2-nonulosonate 5-(acetylamino)-3,5-dideoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-2-nonulosonic acid 5-(acetylamino)-3,5-dideoxy-delta-glycero-beta-delta-galacto-2-nonulopyranosonate 5-(acetylamino)-3,5-dideoxy-delta-glycero-beta-delta-galacto-2-nonulopyranosonic acid 5-(acetylamino)-3,5-dideoxy-delta-glycero-delta-galacto-2-nonulosonate 5-(acetylamino)-3,5-dideoxy-delta-glycero-delta-galacto-2-nonulosonic acid 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nonulosonate 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nonulosonic acid 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-delta-glycero-delta-galacto-nonulosonate 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-delta-glycero-delta-galacto-nonulosonic acid 5-n-acetyl-beta-delta-neuraminic acid 5-n-acetyl-d-neuraminate 5-n-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid 5-n-acetyl-delta-neuraminate 5-n-acetyl-delta-neuraminic acid 5-n-acetylneuraminate 5-n-acetylneuraminic acid aceneuramate aceneuramic acid acetylneuraminate acetylneuraminic acid b-5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nonulopyranosonate b-5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nonulopyranosonic acid b-sialic acid beta-5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-delta-glycero-delta-galacto-nonulopyranosonate beta-5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-delta-glycero-delta-galacto-nonulopyranosonic acid beta-sialic acid lactaminate lactaminic acid n-acetyl-b-d-neuraminate n-acetyl-b-d-neuraminic acid n-acetyl-b-neuraminate n-acetyl-beta-delta-neuraminate n-acetyl-beta-delta-neuraminic acid n-acetyl-beta-neuraminate n-acetyl-d-neuraminate n-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid n-acetyl-delta-neuraminate n-acetyl-delta-neuraminic acid n-acetyl-neuraminate n-acetyl-neuraminic acid n-acetylneuramate n-acetylneuramic acid n-acetylsialate n-acetylsialic acid nan nana neu5ac sialic acid acid, sialic acid, n-acetylneuraminic n acetylneuraminic acid n-acetyl-beta-d-neuraminic acid n-acetyl-beta-neuraminic acid n-acetyl-β-d-neuraminic acid n-acetyl-β-neuraminic acid n-acetylneuraminic acid"

Pyridinecarboxylic acids are compounds containing a pyridine ring bearing a carboxylic acid group. It is also classified as a pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid, which is a dicarboxylic acid with a pyridine backbone. Quinolinic acid is a colorless solid. In plants, it is the biosynthetic precursor to nicotine. Quinolinic acid is found in all organisms, from microbes to plants to animals. Quinolinic acid can be biosynthesized via aspartic acid in plants. Oxidation of aspartate by the enzyme aspartate oxidase gives iminosuccinate, containing the two carboxylic acid groups that are found in quinolinic acid. Condensation of iminosuccinate with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, mediated by quinolinate synthase, affords quinolinic acid Quinolinic acid is also a downstream product of the kynurenine pathway, which metabolizes the amino acid tryptophan ((PMID: 22678511). The kynurenine/tryptophan degradation pathway is important for its production of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and produces several neuroactive intermediates including quinolinic acid, kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HANA). In animals quinolinic acid acts as an NMDA receptor agonist and has a possible role in neurodegenerative disorders (PMID: 22678511). It also acts as a neurotoxin, gliotoxin, proinflammatory mediator, and pro-oxidant molecule (PMID: 22248144). Quinolinic acid can act as an endogenous brain excitotoxin when released by activated macrophages (PMID: 15013955). Within the brain, quinolinic acid is only produced by activated microglia and macrophages. Quinolinic acid is unable to pass through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and must be produced within the brain by microglial cells or macrophages that have passed the BBB (PMID: 22248144). While quinolinic acid cannot pass through the BBB, kynurenic acid, tryptophan and 3-hydroxykynurenine can and can subsequently act as precursors to the production of quinolinic acid in the brain (PMID: 22248144). Quinolinic acid has potent neurotoxic effects. Studies have demonstrated that quinolinic acid may be involved in many psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases in the brain including ALS, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, brain ischemia, Parkinson‚Äôs disease, Huntington‚Äôs disease and AIDS-dementia.  Elevated CSF levels of quinolinic acid are correlated with the severity of neuropsychological deficits in patients who have AIDS. Indeed, levels of quinolinic acid in the CSF of AIDS patients suffering from AIDS-dementia can be up to twenty times higher than normal (PMID: 10936623). Quinolinic acid levels are increased in the brains of children infected with a range of bacterial infections of the central nervous system (CNS), of poliovirus patients, and of Lyme disease with CNS involvement patients. In addition, raised quinolinic acid levels have been found in traumatic CNS injury patients, patients suffering from cognitive decline with ageing, hyperammonaemia patients, hypoglycaemia patients, and systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Quinolinic acid has also been detected, but not quantified in, several different foods, such as Ceylon cinnamons, pitanga, Oregon yampahs, red bell peppers, and durians. This could make quinolinic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of these foods.",HMDB0000232_nmroned_1249_28864.txt,nmroned,"quinolinic acid 2,3-pyridinedicarboxylic acid pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylate 2,3-pyridinedicarboxylate quinolinate pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid 3,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid pyridin-2,3-dicarbonsaeure pyridine-2,3-carboxylate quinolinic acid"

It is the most important androgen in potency and quantity for vertebrates. In humans, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair. In addition, testosterone is involved in health and well-being, and the prevention of osteoporosis. Testosterone exerts its action through binding to and activation of the androgen receptor. In mammals, testosterone is metabolized mainly in the liver. Approximately 50% of testosterone is metabolized via conjugation into testosterone glucuronide and to a lesser extent testosterone sulfate by glucuronosyltransferases and sulfotransferases. An additional 40% of testosterone is metabolized in equal proportions into the 17-ketosteroids androsterone and etiocholanolone via the combined actions of 5alpha- and 5beta-reductases, 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and 17beta-HSD. Like other steroid hormones, testosterone is derived from cholesterol. The first step in the biosynthesis of testosterone involves the oxidative cleavage of the side-chain of cholesterol by the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc, CYP11A1) to give pregnenolone. In the next step, two additional carbon atoms are removed by the CYP17A1 (17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase) enzyme to yield a variety of C19 steroids. In addition, the 3beta-hydroxyl group is oxidized by 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to produce androstenedione. In the final and rate limiting step, the C17 keto group androstenedione is reduced by 17beta-hydroxysteroid hydrogenase to yield testosterone. Testosterone is synthesized and released by the Leydig cells in the testes that lie between the tubules and comprise less than 5% of the total testicular volume. Testosterone diffuses into the seminiferous tubules where it is essential for maintaining spermatogenesis. Some testosterone binds to an androgen-binding protein (ABP) that is produced by the Sertoli cells and is homologous to the sex-hormone binding globulin that transports testosterone in the general circulation. The ABP carries testosterone in the testicular fluid where it maintains the activity of the accessory sex glands and may also help to retain testosterone within the tubule and bind excess free hormone. Some testosterone is converted to estradiol by Sertoli cell-derived aromatase enzyme. Leydig cell steroidogenesis is controlled primarily by luteinizing hormone with negative feedback of testosterone on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The requirement of spermatogenesis for high local concentrations of testosterone means that loss of androgen production is likely to be accompanied by loss of spermatogenesis. Indeed, if testicular androgen production is inhibited by the administration of exogenous androgens then spermatogenesis ceases. This is the basis of using exogenous testosterone as a male contraceptive. The largest amounts of testosterone (>95%) are produced by the testes in men, while the adrenal glands account for most of the remainder. Testosterone is also synthesized in far smaller total quantities in women by the adrenal glands, thecal cells of the ovaries, and, during pregnancy, by the placenta. Testosterone levels fall by about 1% each year in men. Therefore, with increasing longevity and the aging of the population, the number of older men with testosterone deficiency will increase substantially over the next several decades.

Approximately 1% of healthy young men have total serum testosterone levels below normal; in contrast, approximately 20% of healthy men over age 60 years have serum testosterone levels below normal.

Thiamines are compounds containing a thiamine moiety, which is structurally characterized by a 3-[(4-Amino-2-methyl-pyrimidin-5-yl)methyl]-4-methyl-thiazol-5-yl backbone. Thiamine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans.  Thiamine biosynthesis occurs in bacteria, some protozoans, plants, and fungi. Thiamine is a vitamin and an essential nutrient meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and it must be obtained from the diet. It is soluble in water and insoluble in alcohol. Thiamine decomposes if heated. Thiamine was first discovered in 1897 by Umetaro Suzuki in Japan when researching how rice bran cured patients of Beriberi. Thiamine was the first B vitamin to be isolated in 1926 and was first made in 1936. Thiamine plays a key role in intracellular glucose metabolism and it is thought that thiamine inhibits the effect of glucose and insulin on arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation. Thiamine plays an important role in helping the body convert carbohydrates and fat into energy. It is essential for normal growth and development and helps to maintain proper functioning of the heart and the nervous and digestive systems. Thiamine cannot be stored in the body; however, once absorbed, the vitamin is concentrated in muscle tissue. Thiamine has antioxidant, erythropoietic, cognition-and mood-modulatory, antiatherosclerotic, putative ergogenic, and detoxification activities. Natural derivatives of thiamine, such as thiamine monophosphate (ThMP), thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), also sometimes called thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), thiamine triphosphate (ThTP), and adenosine thiamine triphosphate (AThTP), act as coenzymes in addition to performing unique biological functions. Thiamine deficiency can lead to beriberi, Wernicke‚ÄìKorsakoff syndrome, optic neuropathy, Leigh's disease, African seasonal ataxia (or Nigerian seasonal ataxia), and central pontine myelinolysis. In Western countries, thiamine deficiency is seen mainly in chronic alcoholism. Thiamine supplements or thiamine therapy can be used for the treatment of a number of disorders including thiamine and niacin deficiency states, Korsakov's alcoholic psychosis, Wernicke-Korsakov syndrome, delirium, and peripheral neuritis. In humans, thiamine is involved in the metabolic disorder called 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Outside of the human body, Thiamine is found in high quantities in whole grains, legumes, pork, fruits, and yeast and fish. Grain processing removes much of the thiamine content in grains, so in many countries cereals and flours are enriched with thiamine.",HMDB0000235_nmroned_1255_28888.txt,nmroned,"thiamine 3-(4-amino-2-methyl-pyrimidin-5-ylmethyl)-5-(2-hydroxy-ethyl)-4-methyl-thiazol-3-ium aneurin antiberiberi factor thiamin thiamine(1+) ion thiaminium vitamin b1 apate drops beatine bedome begiolan benerva bequin berin betalin s betaxin bethiazine beuion bevitex bevitine bewon biamine bithiamin biuno bivatin bivita cernevit-12 clotiamina eskapen eskaphen hybee lixa-beta metabolin slowten thd thiadoxine thiaminal thiamol thiavit tiamidon tiaminal trophite vetalin s vib vinothiam vitaneuron mononitrate, thiamine thiamine mononitrate vitamin b 1"

It exists a clear liquid with a pungent and unpleasant smell somewhat resembling body odor. Propionic acid (PA) is widely used as an antifungal agent in food. It is present naturally at low levels in dairy products and occurs ubiquitously, together with other short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), in the gastro-intestinal tract of humans and other mammals as an end-product of the microbial digestion of carbohydrates. The metabolism of propionic acid begins with its conversion to propionyl coenzyme A, the usual first step in the metabolism of carboxylic acids. Since propionic acid has three carbons, propionyl-CoA cannot directly enter either beta oxidation or the citric acid cycles. In most vertebrates, propionyl-CoA is carboxylated to D-methylmalonyl-CoA, which is isomerised to L-methylmalonyl-CoA. Propionic acid has significant physiological activity in animals. Propionic acid is irritant but produces no acute systemic effects and has no demonstrable genotoxic potential (PMID 1628870). The human skin is host of several species of bacteria known as Propionibacteria, which are named after their ability to produce propionic acid. The most notable one is the Cutibacterium acnes (formerly known as Propionibacterium acnes), which lives mainly in the sebaceous glands of the skin and is one of the principal causes of acne. Propionic aciduria is one of the most frequent organic acidurias, a disease that comprise many various disorders. The outcome of patients born with Propionic aciduria is poor intellectual development patterns, with 60% having an IQ less than 75 and requiring special education. Successful liver and/or renal transplantations, in a few patients, have resulted in better quality of life but have not necessarily prevented neurological and various visceral complications. These results emphasize the need for permanent metabolic follow-up whatever the therapeutic strategy (PMID 15868474). Decreased early mortality, less severe symptoms at diagnosis, and more favorable short-term neurodevelopmental outcome were recorded in patients identified through expanded newborn screening. (PMID 16763906)‚Üµ When propionic acid is infused directly into rodents' brains, it produces hyperactivity, dystonia, social impairment, perseveration and brain changes (e.g., innate neuroinflammation, glutathione depletion) that may be used as a means to model autism in rats.

Pyridoxine is an essential nutrient, meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and it must be obtained from the diet. Sources in the diet include fruit, vegetables, and grain. Although pyridoxine and vitamin B6 are still frequently used as synonyms, especially by medical researchers, this practice is sometimes misleading (PMID: 2192605). Technically, pyridoxine is one of the compounds that can be called vitamin B6 or it is a member of the family of B6 vitamins. Healthy human blood levels of pyridoxine are 2.1 - 21.7 ng/mL. Pyridoxine is readily converted to pyridoxal phosphate which is a coenzyme for synthesis of amino acids, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine), sphingolipids and aminolevulinic acid. Pyridoxine assists in the balancing of sodium and potassium as well as promoting red blood cell production. Therefore pyridoxine is required by the body to make amino acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. It is linked to cancer immunity and helps fight the formation of homocysteine. It has been suggested that pyridoxine might help children with learning difficulties, and may also prevent dandruff, eczema, and psoriasis. In addition, pyridoxine can help balance hormonal changes in women and aid in immune system. Lack of pyridoxine may cause anemia, nerve damage, seizures, skin problems, and sores in the mouth (Wikipedia). Deficiency of pyridoxine, though rare because of widespread distribution in foods, leads to the development of peripheral neuritis in adults and affects the central nervous system in children (DOSE - 3rd edition). As a supplement pyridoxine is used to treat and prevent pyridoxine deficiency, sideroblastic anaemia, pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy, certain metabolic disorders, problems from isoniazid, and certain types of mushroom poisoning.

Like other keto acids, pyruvic acid can tautomerize from its ketone form to its enol form, containing a double bond and an alcohol. Pyruvate is found in all living organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. It is intermediate compound in the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Pyruvate is a key intermediate in several metabolic pathways throughout the cell. In particular, pyruvic acid can be made from glucose through glycolysis, converted back to carbohydrates (such as glucose) via gluconeogenesis, or to fatty acids through a reaction with acetyl-CoA. Pyruvic acid supplies energy to cells through the citric acid cycle (TCA or Krebs cycle) when oxygen is present (aerobic respiration), and alternatively ferments to produce lactate when oxygen is lacking (lactic acid). In glycolysis, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is converted to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase. This reaction is strongly exergonic and irreversible. In gluconeogenesis, it takes two enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase and PEP carboxykinase, to catalyze the reverse transformation of pyruvate to PEP.

The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T4), which has a longer half-life than T3. In humans, the ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is approximately 14:1. T4 is converted to the active T3 (three to four times more potent than T4) within cells by enzymes known as deiodinases (5‚Ä≤-iodinase). Thyroxine is synthesized via the iodination of tyrosines (monoiodotyrosine) and the coupling of iodotyrosines (diiodotyrosine) in the thyroglobulin. Iodine is critical to the synthesis of thyroxine and other thyroid hormones. Through a reaction with the enzyme thyroperoxidase, iodine is covalently bound to tyrosine residues found in the thyroglobulin protein, forming monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). Linking two moieties of DIT produces thyroxine. Combining one molecule of MIT and one molecule of DIT produces triiodothyronine. Thyroxine is released from thyroglobulin by proteolysis and secreted into the blood. Iodide is actively absorbed from the bloodstream and concentrated in the thyroid follicles where thyroxine is produced. If there is a deficiency of dietary iodine, the thyroid enlarges in an attempt to trap more iodine, resulting in a condition called goitre. More specifically, the lack of thyroid hormones will lead to decreased negative feedback on the pituitary gland, leading to increased production of thyroid-stimulating hormone, which causes the thyroid to enlarge, leading to goitre. Thyroxine can be peripherally de-iodinated to form triiodothyronine which exerts a broad spectrum of stimulatory effects on cell metabolism.  Thyroid hormones function via a well-studied set of nuclear receptors, termed the thyroid hormone receptors. They act on nearly every cell in the body. In particular, thyroid hormones act to increase the basal metabolic rate, affect protein synthesis, help regulate long bone growth (synergy with growth hormone) and neural maturation, and increase the body's sensitivity to catecholamines (such as adrenaline) by permissiveness. The thyroid hormones are essential to proper development and differentiation of all cells of the human body. These hormones also regulate protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism, affecting how human cells use energetic compounds. They also stimulate vitamin metabolism. Numerous physiological and pathological stimuli influence thyroid hormone synthesis. Levothyroxine, a manufactured form of thyroxine, was the most prescribed medication in the United States with more than 114 million prescriptions.

It is a lesser-known amino acid because it is not incorporated into the structural building blocks of protein. Yet taurine is an essential amino acid in pre-term and newborn infants of humans and many other species. Adults can synthesize their own taurine, yet are probably dependent, in part, on dietary taurine. Taurine is abundant in the brain, heart, breast, gallbladder, and kidney and has important roles in health and disease in these organs. Taurine has many diverse biological functions including serving as a neurotransmitter in the brain, a stabilizer of cell membranes, and a facilitator in the transport of ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Taurine is highly concentrated in animal and fish protein, which are good sources of dietary taurine. It can be synthesized by the body from cysteine when vitamin B6 is present. Deficiency of taurine occurs in premature infants, neonates fed formula milk, and various disease states. Several inborn errors of taurine metabolism have been described. Perry syndrome is an unusual neuropsychiatric disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion through three generations of a family. Symptoms began late in the fifth decade in 6 affected persons and death occurred after 4 to 6 years. The earliest and most prominent symptom was mental depression that was not responsive to antidepressant drugs or electroconvulsive therapy. Sleep disturbances, exhaustion, and marked weight loss were features. Parkinsonism developed later, and respiratory failure occurred terminally (OMIM: 168605). Hypertaurinuric cardiomyopathy describes congestive cardiomyopathy and markedly elevated urinary taurine levels (about 5 times normal). Other family members had late or holosystolic mitral valve prolapse and elevated urinary taurine values (about 2.5 times normal). In two with mitral valve prolapse, congestive cardiomyopathy eventually developed while the amounts of urinary taurine doubled (OMIM: 145350). Taurine, after GABA, is the second most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Its inhibitory effect is one source of taurine's anticonvulsant and antianxiety properties. It also lowers glutamic acid in the brain, and preliminary clinical trials suggest taurine may be useful in some forms of epilepsy. Taurine in the brain is usually associated with zinc or manganese. The amino acids alanine and glutamic acid, as well as pantothenic acid, inhibit taurine metabolism while vitamins A and B6, zinc, and manganese help build taurine. Cysteine and B6 are the nutrients most directly involved in taurine synthesis. Taurine levels have been found to decrease significantly in many depressed patients. One reason that the findings are not entirely clear is that taurine is often elevated in the blood of epileptics who need it. It is often difficult to distinguish compensatory changes in human biochemistry from true metabolic or deficiency disease. Low levels of taurine are found in retinitis pigmentosa. Taurine deficiency in experimental animals produces degeneration of light-sensitive cells. Therapeutic applications of taurine to eye disease are likely to be forthcoming. Taurine has many important metabolic roles. Supplements can stimulate prolactin and insulin release. The parathyroid gland makes a peptide hormone called glutataurine (glutamic acid-taurine), which further demonstrates taurine's role in endocrinology. Taurine increases bilirubin and cholesterol excretion in bile, critical to normal gallbladder function. It seems to inhibit the effect of morphine and potentiates the effects of opiate antagonists. Low plasma taurine levels have been found in a variety of conditions, i.e. depression, hypertension, hypothyroidism, gout, institutionalized patients, infertility, obesity, kidney failure, and others (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/).

These are organic compounds containing an alkyl chain with an amine group bound to the C1 atom and an alcohol group bound to the C2 atom. Sphingosine is an 18-carbon amino alcohol with an unsaturated hydrocarbon chain, which forms a primary part of sphingolipids. Sphingolipids are a class of cell membrane lipids that include sphingomyelin. Thus, sphingosine is considered to be a sphingoid base lipid. Sphingosine is a very hydrophobic molecule, practically insoluble (in water), and relatively neutral. Sphingosine is found in all living organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to humans.  Sphingosine is synthesized from palmitoyl CoA and serine in a condensation required to yield dehydrosphingosine. Dehydrosphingosine is then reduced by NADPH to dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine), and finally oxidized by FAD to sphingosine. Within humans and other mammals, sphingosine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, sphingosine can be converted into sphingosine 1-phosphate through its interaction with the enzyme sphingosine kinase 2. sphingosine 1-phosphate is an important signaling molecule. In addition, sphingosine can be biosynthesized from sphingosine 1-phosphate; which is mediated by the enzyme sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase 2. Sphingosine and its derivative sphinganine are the major bases of the sphingolipids in mammals. In humans, sphingosine is involved in globoid cell leukodystrophy.

It is an important component of the citric acid or TCA cycle and is capable of donating electrons to the electron transfer chain. Succinate is found in all living organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to mammals. In eukaryotes, succinate is generated in the mitochondria via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). Succinate can readily be imported into the mitochondrial matrix by the n-butylmalonate- (or phenylsuccinate-) sensitive dicarboxylate carrier in exchange with inorganic phosphate or another organic acid, e. g. malate (PMID 16143825). Succinate can exit the mitochondrial matrix and function in the cytoplasm as well as the extracellular space. Succinate has multiple biological roles including roles as a metabolic intermediate and roles as a cell signalling molecule. Succinate can alter gene expression patterns, thereby modulating the epigenetic landscape or it can exhibit hormone-like signaling functions (PMID: 26971832). As such, succinate links cellular metabolism, especially ATP formation, to the regulation of cellular function. Succinate can be broken down or metabolized into fumarate by the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which is part of the electron transport chain involved in making ATP. Dysregulation of succinate synthesis, and therefore ATP synthesis, can happen in a number of genetic mitochondrial diseases, such as Leigh syndrome, and Melas syndrome. Succinate has been found to be associated with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is an inborn error of metabolism. Succinic acid has recently been identified as an oncometabolite or an endogenous, cancer causing metabolite. High levels of this organic acid can be found in tumors or biofluids surrounding tumors. Its oncogenic action appears to due to its ability to inhibit prolyl hydroxylase-containing enzymes. In many tumours, oxygen availability becomes limited (hypoxia) very quickly due to rapid cell proliferation and limited blood vessel growth. The major regulator of the response to hypoxia is the HIF transcription factor (HIF-alpha). Under normal oxygen levels, protein levels of HIF-alpha are very low due to constant degradation, mediated by a series of post-translational modification events catalyzed by the prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes PHD1, 2 and 3, (also known as EglN2, 1 and 3) that hydroxylate HIF-alpha and lead to its degradation. All three of the PHD enzymes are inhibited by succinate.

Sucrose is also a chemical intermediate for detergents, emulsifying agents, and other sucrose derivatives. Sucrose is widespread in the seeds, leaves, fruits, flowers, and roots of plants, where it functions as an energy store for metabolism and as a carbon source for biosynthesis. The annual world production of sucrose is in excess of 90 million tons mainly from the juice of sugar cane (20%) and sugar beet (17%). In addition to its use as a sweetener, sucrose is used in food products as a preservative, antioxidant, moisture control agent, stabilizer, and thickening agent.

An indoleamine consists of an indole ring that bears an amino group or an alkyl amino group attached to the indole ring. Serotonin has an aminoethyl at position 2 and a hydroxyl group at position 5 of the indole ring. Serotonin exists in all living organisms, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. In mammals, serotonin functions as a monoamine neurotransmitter, a biochemical messenger and regulator. It is synthesized from the essential amino acid L-Tryptophan. Approximately 90% of the human body's total serotonin is located in the enterochromaffin cells in the GI tract, where it regulates intestinal movements. About 8% is found in platelets and 1‚Äì2% in the CNS. Serotonin in the nervous system acts as a local transmitter at synapses, and as a paracrine or hormonal modulator of circuits upon diffusion, allowing a wide variety of ""state-dependent"" behavioral responses to different stimuli. Serotonin is widely distributed in the nervous system of vertebrates and invertebrates and some of its behavioral effects have been preserved along evolution. Such is the case of aggressive behavior and rhythmic motor patterns, including those responsible for feeding.  In vertebrates, which display a wider and much more sophisticated behavioral repertoire, serotonin also modulates sleep, the arousal state, sexual behavior, and others. Deficiencies of the serotonergic system causes disorders such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobias, posttraumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, and generalized anxiety disorder. Serotonin has three different modes of action in the nervous system: as transmitter, acting locally at synaptic boutons; upon diffusion at a distance from its release sites, producing paracrine (also called volume) effects, and by circulating in the blood stream, producing hormonal effects. The three modes can affect a single neuronal circuit. (PMID: 16047543). Serotonin is also a microbial metabolite that can be found in the feces and urine of mammals. Urinary serotonin is produced by Candida, Streptococcus, Escherichia, and Enterococcus (PMID: 24621061). In plants, serotonin was first found and reported in a legume called Mucuna pruriens. The greatest concentration of serotonin in plants has been found in walnuts and hickory.

Thymine was first isolated in 1893 by Albrecht Kossel and Albert Neumann from calves' thymus glands, hence its name. Thymine is one of the 4 nuelcoebases found in DNA and is essential to all life. Thymine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Thymine combined with deoxyribose creates the nucleoside deoxythymidine (also called thymidine) which when phosphorylated to dTDP can be incorporated into DNA via DNA polymerases. Thymidine can be phosphorylated with up to three phosphoric acid groups, producing dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate) dTDP and/or dTTP. In RNA thymine is replaced with uracil in most cases. In DNA, thymine binds to adenine via two hydrogen bonds to assist in stabilizing the nucleic acid structures. Within humans, thymine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, thymine and deoxyribose 1-phosphate can be biosynthesized from thymidine through its interaction with the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase.

It is an uncommon amino acid derivative in which the free amino group of glutamic acid cyclizes to form a lactam. It is formed nonenzymatically from glutamate, glutamine, and gamma-glutamylated peptides, but it can also be produced by the action of gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase on an L-amino acid. Elevated blood levels may be associated with problems of glutamine or glutathione metabolism. This compound is found in substantial amounts in brain tissue and other tissues in bound form, especially skin. It is also present in plant tissues. It is sold, over the counter, as a ""smart drug"" for improving blood circulation in the brain. Pyroglutamate in the urine is a biomarker for the consumption of cheese. When present in sufficiently high levels, pyroglutamic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of pyroglutamic acid are associated with at least five inborn errors of metabolism including 5-oxoprolinuria, 5-oxoprolinase deficiency, glutathione synthetase deficiency, hawkinsinuria, and propionic acidemia. Pyroglutamic acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures. It has been shown that pyroglutamic acid releases GABA from the cerebral cortex and displays anti-anxiety effects in a simple approach-avoidance conflict situation in the rat.

Pyrimidine 2'-deoxyribonucleosides are compounds consisting of a pyrimidine linked to a ribose which lacks a hydroxyl group at position 2. Deoxythymidine (or thymidine) is the DNA nucleoside T, which pairs with deoxyadenosine (A) in double-stranded DNA. Therefore, thymidine is essential to all life. Indeed, thymidine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Within humans, thymidine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, thymidine can be biosynthesized from 5-thymidylic acid through its interaction with the enzyme cytosolic purine 5'-nucleotidase. In addition, thymidine can be converted into 5-thymidylic acid; which is catalyzed by the enzyme thymidine kinase. Deoxythymidine can be phosphorylated with one, two or three phosphoric acid groups, creating dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate), dTDP, or dTTP (for the di- and tri- phosphates, respectively). dTMP can be incorporated into DNA via DNA polymerases. In cell biology, thymidine can be used to synchronize the cells in S phase.

The saccharopine pathway is the main route for lysine degradation in mammals, and its first two reactions are catalyzed by enzymatic activities known as lysine-oxoglutarate reductase (LOR) and saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH), which reside on a single bifunctional polypeptide (LOR/SDH) (EC 1.5.1.8). The reactions involved with saccharopine dehydrogenases have very strict substrate specificity for L-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate, and NADPH. LOR/SDH has been detected in a number of mammalian tissues, mainly in the liver and kidney, contributing not only to the general nitrogen balance in the organism but also to the controlled conversion of lysine into ketone bodies. A tetrameric form has also been observed in human liver and placenta. LOR activity has also been detected in brain mitochondria during embryonic development, and this opens up the question of whether or not lysine degradation has any functional significance during brain development. As a result, there is now a new focus on the nutritional requirements for lysine in gestation and infancy. Finally, LOR and/or SDH deficiencies seem to be involved in a human autosomal genetic disorder known as familial hyperlysinemia, which is characterized by serious defects in the functioning of the nervous system and characterized by a deficiency in lysine-ketoglutarate reductase, saccharopine dehydrogenase, and saccharopine oxidoreductase activities. Saccharopinuria (high amounts of saccharopine in the urine) and saccharopinemia (an excess of saccharopine in the blood) are conditions present in some inherited disorders of lysine degradation (PMID: 463877, 10567240, 10772957, 4809305). If present in sufficiently high levels, saccharopine can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Saccharopine is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy).

Ribose is not an essential nutrient because it can be synthesized by almost every tissue in the body from other substances, such as glucose. It is vital for life as a component of DNA, RNA, ATP, ADP, and AMP. In nature, small amounts of ribose can be found in ripe fruits and vegetables. Brewer's yeast, which has a high concentration of RNA, is another rich source of ribose. D-ribose is also a component of many so-called energy drinks and anti-ageing products available on the market today. Ribose is a structural component of ATP, which is the primary energy source for exercising muscle. The adenosine component is an adenine base attached to the five-carbon sugar ribose. ATP provides energy to working muscles by releasing a phosphate group, hence becoming ADP, which in turn may release a phosphate group, then becoming AMP. During intense muscular activity, the total amount of ATP available is quickly depleted. In an effort to correct this imbalance, AMP is broken down in the muscle and secreted from the cell. Once the breakdown products of AMP are released from the cell, the energy potential (TAN pool) of the muscle is reduced and ATP must then be reformed using ribose. Ribose helps restore the level of adenine nucleotides by bypassing the rate-limiting step in the de novo (oxidative pentose phosphate) pathway, which regenerates phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), the essential precursor for ATP. If ribose is not readily available to a cell, glucose may be converted to ribose. Ribose supplementation has been shown to increase the rate of ATP resynthesis following intense exercise. The use of ribose in men with severe coronary artery disease resulted in improved exercise tolerance. Hence, there is interest in the potential of ribose supplements to boost muscular performance in athletic activities (PMID: 17618002, Curr Sports Med Rep. 2007 Jul;6(4):254-7.).",HMDB0000283_nmroned_1311_29126.txt,nmroned,"d-ribose (3r,4s,5r)-5-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran-2,3,4-triol ribose d-ribofuranoside d-​ribofuranose ribofuranoside ribofuranose"

Pyrimidine nucleosides are compounds comprising a pyrimidine base attached to a ribosyl or deoxyribosyl moiety. More specifically, uridine is a nucleoside consisting of uracil and D-ribose and a component of RNA. Uridine is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Uridine can be synthesized from uracil. It is one of the five standard nucleosides which make up nucleic acids, the others being adenosine, thymidine, cytidine and guanosine. The five nucleosides are commonly abbreviated to their one-letter codes U, A, T, C and G respectively. Uridine is also a parent compound for other transformation products, including but not limited to, nikkomycin Z, 3'-(enolpyruvyl)uridine 5'-monophosphate, and 5-aminomethyl-2-thiouridine. Uridine can be found in most biofluids, including urine, breast milk, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and blood. Within the cell, uridine is primarily located in the mitochondria, in the nucleus and the lysosome. It can also be found in the extracellular space. As an essential nucleoside, uridine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to humans. In humans, uridine is involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include dhydropyrimidinase deficiency,  MNGIE (mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy), and beta-ureidopropionase deficiency. Moreover, uridine is found to be associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which is an inborn error of metabolism. Uridine is a nucleoside consisting of uracil and D-ribose and a component of RNA. Uridine plays a role in the glycolysis pathway of galactose. In humans there is no catabolic process to metabolize galactose. Therefore, galactose is converted to glucose and metabolized via the normal glucose metabolism pathways. More specifically, consumed galactose is converted into galactose 1-phosphate (Gal-1-P). This molecule is a substrate for the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase which transfers a UDP molecule to the galactose molecule. The end result is UDP-galactose and glucose-1-phosphate. This process is continued to allow the proper glycolysis of galactose. Uridine is found in many foods (anything containing RNA) but is destroyed in the liver and gastrointestinal tract, and so no food, when consumed, has ever been reliably shown to elevate blood uridine levels. On the other hand, consumption of RNA-rich foods may lead to high levels of purines (adenine and guanosine) in blood. High levels of purines are known to increase uric acid production and may aggravate or lead to conditions such as gout.",HMDB0000296_nmroned_1319_29160.txt,nmroned,"uridine 1-beta-d-ribofuranosylpyrimidine-2,4(1h,3h)-dione 1-beta-d-ribofuranosyluracil beta-uridine u urd uridin 1-b-d-ribofuranosylpyrimidine-2,4(1h,3h)-dione 1-β-d-ribofuranosylpyrimidine-2,4(1h,3h)-dione 1-b-d-ribofuranosyluracil 1-β-d-ribofuranosyluracil b-uridine β-uridine 1-b-d-ribofuranosyl-2,4(1h,3h)-pyrimidinedione 1-beta-delta-ribofuranosyl-2,4(1h,3h)-pyrimidinedione 1-beta-delta-ribofuranosyluracil b-d-ribofuranoside 2,4(1h,3h)-pyrimidinedione-1 beta-delta-ribofuranoside 2,4(1h,3h)-pyrimidinedione-1 allo uridine allo-uridine allouridine"

Pyrimidones are compounds that contain a pyrimidine ring, which bears a ketone. Pyrimidine is a 6-membered ring consisting of four carbon atoms and two nitrogen centers at the 1- and 3- ring positions. Uracil is a common naturally occurring pyrimidine found in RNA. It base pairs with adenine and is replaced by thymine in DNA. Uracil is one of the four nucleobases in RNA that are represented by the letters A, G, C and U. Methylation of uracil produces thymine. The name ""uracil"" was coined in 1885 by the German chemist Robert Behrend, who was attempting to synthesize derivatives of uric acid. Originally discovered in 1900, uracil was isolated by hydrolysis of yeast nuclein that was found in bovine thymus and spleen, herring sperm, and wheat germ. Uracil exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Uracil's use in the body is to help carry out the synthesis of many enzymes necessary for cell function through bonding with riboses and phosphates. Uracil serves as an allosteric regulator and a coenzyme for many important biochemical reactions. Uracil (via the nucleoside uridine) can be phosphorylated by various kinases to produce UMP, UDP and UTP. UDP and UTP regulate carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (CPSase II) activity in animals. Uracil is also involved in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides and in the transport of sugars containing aldehydes. Within humans, uracil participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, uracil and ribose 1-phosphate can be biosynthesized from uridine; which is mediated by the enzyme uridine phosphorylase 2. In addition, uracil can be converted into dihydrouracil through the action of the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase [NADP(+)].  Uracil is rarely found in DNA, and this may have been an evolutionary change to increase genetic stability. This is because cytosine can deaminate spontaneously to produce uracil through hydrolytic deamination. Therefore, if there were an organism that used uracil in its DNA, the deamination of cytosine (which undergoes base pairing with guanine) would lead to formation of uracil (which would base pair with adenine) during DNA synthesis. Uracil can be used for drug delivery and as a pharmaceutical.

In the liver, urocanic acid is an intermediate in the conversion of histidine to glutamic acid, whereas, in the epidermis, it accumulates and may be both a UV protectant and an immunoregulator. Urocanic acid (UA) exists as a trans isomer (t-UA, approximately 30 mg/cm2) in the uppermost layer of the skin (stratum corneum). t-UA is formed as the cells of the second layer of the skin become metabolically inactive. During this process, proteins and membranes degrade, histidine is released, and histidase (histidine ammonia lyase) catalyzes the deamination of histidine to form t-UA. t-UA accumulates in the epidermis until removal by either the monthly skin renewal cycle or sweat. Upon absorption of UV light, the naturally occurring t-UA isomerizes to its cis form, c-UA. Because DNA lesions (e.g., pyrimidine dimers) in the lower epidermis can result from UV-B absorption, initial research proposed that t-UA acted as a natural sunscreen absorbing UV-B in the stratum corneum before the damaging rays could penetrate into lower epidermal zones. Researchers have found that c-UA also suppresses contact hypersensitivity and delayed hypersensitivity, reduces the Langerhans cell count in the epidermis, prolongs skin-graft survival time, and affects natural killer cell activity.

UDPgal is a product of the galactose-l-phosphate uridyl transferase (EC 2.7.7.10) reaction but may also be made from Glucose-l-P, involving uridine diphosphate galactose-4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.2). UDPgal is the necessary galactosyl donor of galactose in the metabolism to incorporate it into complex oligosaccharides, glycoproteins and glycolipids (galactosides). Defective galactosylation of complex glycoconjugates exists in tissues from galactosemic patients. There is a tendency for galactosemic red cell UDPgal to be in the low normal range with a high uridine diphosphate glucose to UDP-gal ratio. This may reflect an inability of red cell UDPgal-4'-epimerase to maintain a normal ratio and consequently higher levels of UDPgal. In the more complex white blood cells and cultured fibroblasts, the UDPgal content and the uridine diphosphate glucose to UDPgal ratio of galactosemics are normal. Therefore, defective galactosylation observed in galactosemic fibroblasts must result from a defect in the transfer of galactose from UDPgal to these moieties.

These are bile acids bearing a hydroxyl group. Bile acids facilitate fat absorption and cholesterol excretion. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in the bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, and depends only on the presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine, and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH, and consequently require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g. membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues (PMID: 11316487 , 16037564 , 12576301 , 11907135 ). When present in sufficiently high levels, bile acids can act as hepatotoxins and metabotoxisn. A hepatotoxin causes damage to the liver or liver cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Among the primary bile acids, cholic acid is considered to be the least hepatotoxic while deoxycholic acid is the most hepatoxic (PMID: 1641875 ). The liver toxicity of bile acids appears to be due to their ability to peroxidate lipids and to lyse liver cells. Chronically high levels of cholic acid are associated with familial hypercholanemia. In hypercholanemia, bile acids are elevated in the blood. This disease causes liver damage, extensive itching, poor fat absorption, and can lead to rickets due to lack of calcium in bones. The deficiency of normal bile acids in the intestines results in a deficiency of vitamin K, which also adversely affects clotting of the blood.

Catechols are compounds containing a 1,2-benzenediol moiety. 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylglycol is an extremely weak basic (essentially neutral) compound. 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylglycol exists in all living organisms, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. It is a potent antioxidant (PMID: 30007612). In mammals, 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylglycol is the primary metabolite of norepinephrine and is generated through the action of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO). DHPG is then further metabolized by the enzyme Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG). Within humans, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol can be biosynthesized from 3,4-dihydroxymandelaldehyde; which is mediated by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase 1A. In addition, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol and guaiacol can be converted into vanylglycol and pyrocatechol through its interaction with the enzyme catechol O-methyltransferase. Outside of the human body, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol is found, on average, in the highest concentration in olives. High levels of DHPG (up to 368 mg/kg of dry weight) have been found in the pulp of natural black olives. This could make 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol a potential biomarker for the consumption of olives and olive oil. 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylglycol has been linked to Menkes disease (PMID: 19234788). DHPG level are lower in Menkes patients (3.57 ¬± 0.40 nM) than healthy infants 8.91 ¬± 0.77 nM). Menkes disease (also called ‚Äúkinky hair disease‚Äù) is an X-linked recessive neurodevelopmental disorder caused by defects in a gene that encodes a copper-transporting ATPase (ATP7A). Affected infants typically appear healthy at birth and show normal neurodevelopment for 2-3 months.

When present in sufficiently high levels, 2-hydroxyadipic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of 2-hydroxyadipic acid are associated with at least three inborn errors of metabolism including  2-oxoadipic acidemia, 2-aminoadipic aciduria, and 2-oxoadipic aciduria. 2-Hydroxyadipic acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above.

These are steroids with a structure containing a 3-hydroxylated estrane. Thus, 2-hydroxyestradiol is considered to be a steroid molecule. It is a metabolite of estradiol, as well as a positional isomer of estriol. Transformation of estradiol to 2-hydroxyestradiol is a major metabolic pathway of estradiol in the liver. 2-Hydroxyestradiol is generated from estradiol via several cytochrome P450 enzymes. Specifically, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are the major enzymes catalyzing the 2-hydroxylation of estradiol. Conversion of estradiol into 2-hydroxyestradiol has been detected in the liver, uterus, breast, kidney, brain, and pituitary gland, as well as the placenta. 2-Hydroxyestradiol binds, with a low affinity, to estrogen receptors. 2-Hydroxyestradiol has approximately 7% and 11% of the affinity of estradiol at the estrogen receptors (ERs) ERalpha and ERbeta, respectively (PMID: 9048584). 2-Hydroxyestradiol is a catechol estrogen and in this regard bears some structural resemblance to the catecholamines dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline) (PMID: 447670).  In accordance, 2-hydroxyestradiol has been found to interact with catecholamine systems. The steroid is known to compete with catecholamines for binding to catechol O-methyltransferase and tyrosine hydroxylase and to competitively inhibit these enzymes (PMID: 447670).

Acyl glycines are normally minor metabolites of fatty acids. However, the excretion of certain acyl glycines is increased in several inborn errors of metabolism, such as propionic acidemia. In certain cases the measurement of these metabolites in body fluids can be used to diagnose disorders associated with mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.13) which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction: acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine. The isolated excretion of high levels of 2-methylbutyrylglycine (2-MBG) is the hallmark of short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency or SBCADD (PMID:15615815). The disorder is also called 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (PMID: 17883863) and has been associated with autism and mental retardation. SBCADD is a recently described autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the degradation pathway of L- isoleucine leading to increased urinary excretion of 2-methylbutyryl glycine. The enzymatic defect results from disruption of the SBCAD gene. Deficiency of SBCAD leads to accumulation of its substrate, 2-methylbutyryl-CoA within the mitochondrion. This substance is transesterified with glycine by the mitochondrial enzyme acyl-CoA glycine-N-acyltransferase (glycine-N-acylase) to form 2-methylbutyryl glycine. Affected patients can be divided into two categories. The first category consists of infants detected by newborn screening programmes.

The minor pathway leads to 4-hydroxyestrone (4-OHE1). 2a-hydroxyestrone is considered to be the good steroid metabolite (PMID: 8943806) as 2-hydroxyestrone does not stimulate cell growth and it blocks the action of stronger estrogens that may be carcinogenic. 2-hydroxyestrone is not significantly uterotrophic, whereas other hydroxylated estrogen metabolites including 2-hydroxyestradiol, 16a-hydroxyestrone, estriol, 4-hydroxyestradiol, and 4-hydroxyestrone all are. A low urinary ratio of 2-hydroxyestrone to 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone is a strong predictor of breast cancer risk among women (PMID: 19502596).",HMDB0000343_nmroned_1338_29245.txt,nmroned,"2-hydroxyestrone 2,3-dihydroxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-one 2-ohe1 catecholestrone 2-hydroxyestrone, 4-(14)c-labeled"

Marked elevation of urinary 3-hydroxydecanedioic acid has also been reported in a malnourished infant with glycogen storage disease (PMID: 8295400).

It is produced by defective or inefficient versions of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase, an enzyme that normally catalyzes the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate. If this enzyme is defective, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA will accumulate in the mitochondria. Increased concentrations of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA can lead to a disruption of the esterified CoA:free CoA ratio and ultimately to mitochondrial toxicity. Detoxification of these CoA end products occurs via the transfer of the 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl moiety to carnitine, forming 3-hydroxymethylglutaric-carnitine, which is then transferred across the inner mitochondrial membrane where 3-hydroxymethylglutaric acid is released as the free acid. 3-Hydroxymethylglutaric acid has been found to accumulate in the urine of patients affected by 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria, a rare inborn error of metabolism (OMIM: 246450). 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria is caused by significantly reduced enzyme activity of the intramitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (EC 4.1.3.4), the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of leucine degradation.  This enzyme also plays a key role in ketone body formation. The profile of urinary organic acids for individuals with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria is different from that of the other identified defects of leucine degradation, such as maple syrup urine disease (OMIM: 248600), isovaleric acidemia (OMIM: 243500), and methylcrotonylglycinemia (OMIM: 210200). The urinary organic acid profile of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria includes elevated concentrations of 3-hydroxy-3-isovaleric, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric, 3-methylglutaconic, and 3-methylglutaric acids (PMID: 10916782, 9658458, 3063529). Clinical manifestations of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria include hepatomegaly, lethargy, coma, and apnea. Biochemically, there is a characteristic absence of ketosis with hypoglycemia, acidosis, hypertransaminasemia, and variable hyperammonemia. Therefore, when present in sufficiently high concentrations, 3-hydroxymethylglutaric acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. As noted above, chronically high levels of 3-hydroxymethylglutaric acid are associated with the inborn error of metabolism 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency. 3-Hydroxymethylglutaric acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures.",HMDB0000355_nmroned_1342_29264.txt,nmroned,"3-hydroxymethylglutaric acid (s)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid (s)-meglutol 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaric acid 3-hydroxy-3-methylpentanedioic acid beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaric acid dicrotalic acid meglutol meglutolum 3-hydorxy-3-methylglutaric acid (s)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutarate 3-hydroxy-3-methylpentanedioate b-hydroxy-b-methylglutarate b-hydroxy-b-methylglutaric acid beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutarate β-hydroxy-β-methylglutarate β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaric acid dicrotalate 3-hydorxy-3-methylglutarate 3-hydroxymethylglutarate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid 3-methyl-3-hydroxyglutarate 3-methyl-3-hydroxyglutaric acid cb 337 3 hydroxy 3 methylpentanedioic acid acid, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid, 3-hydroxy-3-methylpentanedioic beta hydroxy beta methylglutarate 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaric acid 3-methyl-3-hydroxypentanedioate 3-methyl-3-hydroxypentanedioic acid hmg hmga lipoglutaren medroglutarate medroglutaric acid"

Formally it is a 17alpha-hydroxy steroid that is the 17alpha-hydroxy derivative of progesterone. 17-Hydroxyprogesterone is found in all vertebrates. It is a chemical intermediate in the biosynthesis of many endogenous steroids, including androgens, estrogens, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and neurosteroids. In particular, 17-Hydroxyprogesterone serves as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of hydrocortisone and gonadal steroid hormones. It is derived from progesterone via the enzyme known as 17-hydroxylase, a cytochrome P450 enzyme also known as CYP17A1. It can also be biosynthesized from 17-hydroxypregnenolone via the enzyme 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta5-4 isomerase (PMID: 1955079). 17-OHP is an agonist of the progesterone receptor (PR). It is also an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) as well as a partial agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). 17-Hydroxyprogesterone is a natural progestin and in pregnancy it increases in the third trimester primarily due to fetal adrenal production. 17-Hydroxyprogesterone is primarily produced in the adrenal glands and to some degree in the gonads, specifically the corpus luteum of the ovary. Normal levels are 3-90 ng/dl in children, and in women, 15-70 ng/dl prior to ovulation, and 35-290 ng/dl during the luteal phase. Measurements of levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone are useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected congenital adrenal hyperplasia as the typical enzymes that are defective, namely 21-hydroxylase, lead to a build-up of 17-OHP. 17-OHP levels can also be used to measure contribution of progestational activity of the corpus luteum during pregnancy as progesterone but not 17-OHP is also contributed by the placenta.",HMDB0000374_nmroned_1349_29295.txt,nmroned,"17-hydroxyprogesterone 17-hydroxypregn-4-en-3,20-dione 17alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnene-3,20-dione 17alpha-hydroxy-progesterone delta(4)-pregnene-17alpha-ol-3,20-dione hidroxiprogesterona hydroxyprogesterone hydroxyprogesteronum pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione-17-ol 17a-hydroxy-4-pregnene-3,20-dione 17α-hydroxy-4-pregnene-3,20-dione 17a-hydroxy-progesterone 17α-hydroxy-progesterone delta(4)-pregnene-17a-ol-3,20-dione δ(4)-pregnene-17α-ol-3,20-dione δ(4)-pregnene-17a-ol-3,20-dione 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone 17-hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione 17-oh progesterone 17-ohp 17a-hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione 17a-hydroxyprogesterone 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone d4-pregnen-17a-ol-3,20-dione gestageno gestageno gador pregn-4-en-17a-ol-3,20-dione prodix prodox 17 hydroxyprogesterone 17-hydroxyprogesterone, (17 alpha)-isomer 17 alpha hydroxyprogesterone 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone 17-hydroxyprogesterone, (9 beta, 10 alpha)-isomer"

More specifically, it is an 2-methylbutanoic acid ester of carnitine. Acylcarnitines were first discovered more than 70 year ago (PMID: 13825279). It is believed that there are more than 1000 types of acylcarnitines in the human body. The general role of acylcarnitines is to transport acyl-groups (organic acids and fatty acids) from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria so that they can be broken down to produce energy.  This process is known as beta-oxidation. According to a recent review [Dambrova et al. 2021, Physiological Reviews], acylcarnitines (ACs) can be classified into 9 different categories depending on the type and size of their acyl-group: 1) short-chain ACs; 2) medium-chain ACs; 3) long-chain ACs; 4) very long-chain ACs; 5) hydroxy ACs; 6) branched chain ACs; 7) unsaturated ACs; 8) dicarboxylic ACs and 9) miscellaneous ACs. Short-chain ACs have acyl-groups with two to five carbons (C2-C5), medium-chain ACs have acyl-groups with six to thirteen carbons (C6-C13), long-chain ACs have acyl-groups with fourteen to twenty once carbons (C14-C21) and very long-chain ACs have acyl groups with more than 22 carbons. 2-Methylbutyroylcarnitine is therefore classified as a short chain AC. As a short-chain acylcarnitine 2-methylbutyroylcarnitine is a member of the most abundant group of carnitines in the body, comprising more than 50% of all acylcarnitines quantified in tissues and biofluids (PMID: 31920980). Some short-chain carnitines have been studied as supplements or treatments for a number of diseases, including neurological disorders and inborn errors of metabolism. In particular 2-methylbutyroylcarnitine is elevated in the blood or plasma of individuals with exudative age-related macular degeneration (PMID: 32120889), type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (PMID: 31782507, PMID: 20111019), obesity (PMID: 20111019), acute cerebral infarction (PMID: 29265114), diastolic heart failure (PMID: 26010610), systolic heart failure (PMID: 26010610). It is also decreased in the blood or plasma of individuals with pregnancy (PMID: 24704061 - in serum of pregnant women with fetus with CHD). Carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT, EC:2.3.1.7) is responsible for the synthesis of all short-chain and short branched-chain acylcarnitines (PMID: 23485643). The study of acylcarnitines is an active area of research and it is likely that many novel acylcarnitines will be discovered in the coming years. It is also likely that many novel roles in health and disease will be uncovered. An excellent review of the current state of knowledge for acylcarnitines is available at [Dambrova et al. 2021, Physiological Reviews].",HMDB0000378_nmroned_1350_29300.txt,nmroned,2-methylbutyroylcarnitine 3-[(2-methylbutanoyl)oxy]-4-(trimethylammonio)butanoate 3-[(2-methylbutanoyl)oxy]-4-(trimethylammonio)butanoic acid (2-methylbutyryl)carnitine l-2-methylbutyrate (3-carboxy-2-hydroxypropyl)trimethyl-hydroxide ammonium inner salt methylbutyroyl-carnitine

The structure of citramalic acid is similar to the structure of malic acid except it has an extra CH3 group on position 2. It is also classified as a 2-hydroxydicarboxylic acid. Citramalic acid exists in two isomers, L-citramalic acid and D-citramalic acid.  The L-isomer is more biologically relevant isomer. Citramalic acid is found in almost all living organisms from microbes to plants to humans although citramalate is primarily produced from bacteria. L-citramalic acid was first isolated from the peel of apples in 1954 (PMID: 13160011). It has also been isolated in wine and other ripening fruit (PMID: 13807713). Citramalic acid can inhibit the production of malic acid. Citramalic acid is also an important microbial metabolite and has been found to be a byproduct of Saccharomyces yeast species, as well as Propionibacterium acnes and Aspergillus niger (PMID: 31827810) (http://drweyrich.weyrich.com/labs/oat.html) (PMID: 7628083). Citramalic acid is a component of the C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism pathway. It can be broken down by the enzyme citramalate lyase, which converts citramalate to acetate and pyruvate. Citramalate synthase is an enzyme found in bacteria that synthesizes citramalic acid from acetyl-CoA, pyruvate and water. Citramalic acid may have a useful role in medical diagnoses. It has been found in the urine of two brothers with autistic features (PMID: 7628083). Citramalic acid can also be used as a urinary marker for gut dysbiosis (PMID: 31669633).

These are organic compounds containing exactly two carboxylic acid groups. 3-Hydroxyglutaric acid is soluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). When present in sufficiently high levels, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of 3-hydroxyglutaric acid are associated with glutaric aciduria type I (glutaric acidemia type I, glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, GA1, or GAT1). GA1 is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to completely break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan due to a deficiency of mitochondrial glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.7, GCDH). Excessive levels of their intermediate breakdown products (e.g. glutaric acid, glutaryl-CoA, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaconic acid) can accumulate and cause damage to the brain (and also other organs), but particularly the basal ganglia. GA1 is associated with a risk for intracranial and retinal hemorrhage, and non-specific white matter changes. Babies with glutaric acidemia type I are often born with unusually large heads (macrocephaly). Other symptoms include spasticity (increased muscle tone/stiffness) and dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions resulting in abnormal movement or posture), but many affected individuals are asymptomatic. Seizures and coma (encephalopathy) are rare.

It has approximately 100-fold lower estrogenic potency than 17beta-estradiol. 17alpha-estradiol is a non-feminizing estrogen with significantly reduced binding affinity for the classic estrogen receptors ERalpha and ERbeta. Although 17alpha-estradiol is far weaker than 17beta-estradiol as an agonist of the nuclear estrogen receptors, it has been found to bind to and activate the brain-expressed ER-X with a greater potency than that of 17beta-estradiol.  17alpha-Estradiol is a potent 5-alpha reductase inhibitor that has been shown to improve metabolic function, enhance insulin sensitivity, and reduce fat and inflammation in older lab animals without causing feminization (PMID: 26809497).

N-acyl-alpha amino acids are compounds containing an alpha amino acid which bears an acyl group at its terminal nitrogen atom. N-alpha-Acetyl-L-lysine can also be classified as an alpha amino acid or a derivatized alpha amino acid. Technically, N-alpha-Acetyl-L-lysine is a biologically available N-terminal capped form of the proteinogenic alpha amino acid L-lysine. Unlike L-lysine, acetylated lysine derivatives such as N-alpha-Acetyl-L-lysine are zwitterionic compounds. These are molecules that contains an equal number of positively- and negatively-charged functional groups. N-alpha-Acetyl-L-lysine is found naturally in eukaryotes ranging from yeast to plants to humans. N-acetyl amino acids can be produced either via direct synthesis of specific N-acetyltransferases or via the proteolytic degradation of N-acetylated proteins by specific hydrolases. N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a widespread and highly conserved process in eukaryotes that is involved in protection and stability of proteins (PMID: 16465618).  About 85% of all human proteins and 68% of all yeast proteins are acetylated at their N-terminus (PMID: 21750686). Several proteins from prokaryotes and archaea are also modified by N-terminal acetylation. The majority of eukaryotic N-terminal-acetylation reactions occur through N-acetyltransferase enzymes or NAT‚Äôs (PMID: 30054468).  These enzymes consist of three main oligomeric complexes NatA, NatB, and NatC, which are composed of at least a unique catalytic subunit and one unique ribosomal anchor. The substrate specificities of different NAT enzymes are mainly determined by the identities of the first two N-terminal residues of the target protein. The human NatA complex co-translationally acetylates N-termini that bear a small amino acid (A, S, T, C, and occasionally V and G) (PMID: 30054468). NatA also exists in a monomeric state and can post-translationally acetylate acidic N-termini residues (D-, E-). NatB and NatC acetylate N-terminal methionine with further specificity determined by the identity of the second amino acid.  N-acetylated amino acids, such as N-alpha-Acetyl-L-lysine can be released by an N-acylpeptide hydrolase from peptides generated by proteolytic degradation (PMID: 16465618). In addition to the NAT enzymes and protein-based acetylation, N-acetylation of free lysine can also occur. In particular, N-alpha-Acetyl-L-lysine can be biosynthesized from L-lysine and acetyl-CoA via the enzyme known as Lysine N-acetyltransferase.  Individuals with hyperlysinaemia due to L-lysine alpha-ketoglutarate reductase deficiency will excrete high levels of N-alpha-Acetyl-L-lysine in their urine (PMID: 116084). L-lysine alpha-ketoglutarate reductase deficiency, if untreated, can lead to neurological and behavioral deficits (PMID: 116084).

These glycosylated forms of hydroxylysine contribute to collagen‚Äôs unusual toughness and resiliency. The monoglycosylated, galactosyl-hydroxylysine is enriched in bone compared with the disaccharide form, glucosyl-galactosyl-hydroxylysine, which is the major form in skin. 5-Hydroxylysine exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. It was first discovered in 1921 by Donald Van Slyke. Free forms of hydroxylysine arise through proteolytic degradation of collagen.  Urinary excretion of 5-Hydroxylysine and its glycosides can be used as an index of collagen degradation, with high levels being indicative of more rapid or extensive collagen degradation (often seen in patients with thermal burns, Paget's disease of bone or hyperphosphatasia) (PMID: 404321).",HMDB0000450_nmroned_1375_29424.txt,nmroned,"5-hydroxylysine (2s,5r)-5-hydroxylysine (5r)-5-hydroxy-l-lysine alpha,epsilon-diamino-delta-hydroxycaproic acid l-erythro-5-hydroxylysine l-normal-5-hydroxylysine 5-hydroxy-l-lysine a,epsilon-diamino-delta-hydroxycaproate a,epsilon-diamino-delta-hydroxycaproic acid alpha,epsilon-diamino-delta-hydroxycaproate α,epsilon-diamino-δ-hydroxycaproate α,epsilon-diamino-δ-hydroxycaproic acid lysine, 5 hydroxy 2,6-diamino-5-hydroxyhexanoic acid 5 hydroxylysine hydroxylysine (2s,5r)-2,6-diamino-5-hydroxyhexanoic acid 2,6 diamino 5 hydroxyhexanoic acid a,epsilon-diamino-δ-hydroxycaproate a,epsilon-diamino-δ-hydroxycaproic acid (2s,5r)-2,6-diamino-5-hydroxyhexanoate 5-hydroxy-lysine d-hydroxy-l-lysine d-hydroxylysine delta-dl-hydroxylysine delta-hydroxy-l-lysine delta-hydroxylysine erythro-5-hydroxy-l-lysine hydroxy-lysine l-d-hydroxylysine l-delta-hydroxylysine procollagen 5-hydroxy-l-lysine procollagen l-erythro-5-hydroxy-l-lysine 5-hydroxylysine"

Biopterin compounds found within the animals include BH4 (tetrahydrobiopterin), the free radical BH3, and BH2 (also a free radical, called Dihydrobiopterin). BH2 is produced in the synthesis of L-DOPA, dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine. It is restored to the required cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin by the enzyme dihydrobiopterin reductase. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a cofactor of the three aromatic amino acid hydroxylase enzymes, used in the degradation of amino acid phenylalanine and in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), melatonin, dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), epinephrine (adrenaline). It is also a cofactor for the production of nitric oxide (NO) by the nitric oxide syntheses.    Tetrahydrobiopterin is biosynthesized from guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by three chemical reactions mediated by the enzymes GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS), and sepiapterin reductase (SR).

There are 3 distinct forms of phenylketonuria or hyperphenylalaninemia, each caused by lack of aromatic amino acid hydroxylase enzymes. The variant forms of hyperphenylalaninemia that are caused by the lack of dihydropteridine reductase or tetrahydrobiopterin are characterized by severe neurological deterioration, impaired functioning of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases, and the resultant deficiency of tyrosine- and tryptophan-derived monoamine neurotransmitters in brain.

Methylamino acids are primarily proteogenic amino acids (found in proteins) which have been methylated (in situ) on their side chains by various methyltransferase enzymes. 3-Methylhistidine is also classified as a member of the class of compounds known as L-alpha-amino acids. L-alpha-Amino acids are alpha amino acids which have the L-configuration of the alpha-carbon atom. Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. 3-Methylhistidine is generated from histidine residues found in proteins. Histidine can be methylated at either the N1 or N3 position of its imidazole ring, yielding the isomers 1-methylhistidine (1MH; also referred to as pi-methylhistidine) or 3-methylhistidine (3MH; tau-methylhistidine), respectively. There is considerable confusion with regard to the nomenclature of the methylated nitrogen atoms on the imidazole ring of histidine and other histidine-containing peptides such as anserine. In particular, older literature (mostly prior to the year 2000) designated anserine (Npi methylated) as beta-alanyl-N1-methyl-histidine, whereas according to standard IUPAC nomenclature, anserine is correctly named as beta-alanyl-N3-methyl-histidine. As a result, many papers published prior to the year 2000 incorrectly identified 1MH as a specific marker for dietary consumption or various pathophysiological effects when they really were referring to 3MH (PMID: 24137022).  Histidine methylation on the 3- or tau site is mediated by the enzyme known as METTL18. METTL18 is a nuclear methyltransferase protein that contains a functional nuclear localization signal and accumulates in nucleoli. Urinary concentrations of 3-methylhistidine can be used as a biomarker for skeletal muscle protein breakdown in humans who have been subject to muscle injury (PMID: 16079625). 3-methylhistidine is formed by the posttranslational methylation of histidine residues of the main myofibrillar proteins actin and myosin. During protein catabolism, 3-methylhistidine is released but cannot be reutilized. Therefore, the plasma concentration and urine excretion of 3-methylhistidine are sensitive markers of myofibrillar protein degradation (PMID: 32235743). Approximately 75% of 3-methylhistidine is estimated to originate from skeletal muscle (PMID: 32235743). In addition to the degradation of muscle proteins, the 3-methylhistidine level is affected by the degradation of intestinal proteins and meat intake. 3-Methylhistidine exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. In humans, 3-methylhistidine is involved in methylhistidine metabolism. 3-Methylhistidine has been found to be associated with several diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 2, eosinophilic esophagitis, and kidney disease. The normal concentration of 3-methylhistidine in the urine of healthy adult humans has been detected and quantified in a range of 3.63‚Äì69.27 micromoles per millimole (umol/mmol) of creatinine, with most studies reporting the average urinary concentration between 15‚Äì20 umol/mmol of creatinine.  The average concentration of 3-methylhistidine in human blood plasma has been detected and quantified at 2.85 micromolar (uM) with a range of 0.0‚Äì5.9 uM.

A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of 3-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid are associated with maple syrup urine disease. MSUD is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), leading to a buildup of the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and their toxic by-products (ketoacids) in the blood and urine. The symptoms of MSUD often show in infancy and lead to severe brain damage if untreated. MSUD may also present later depending on the severity of the disease. If left untreated in older individuals, during times of metabolic crisis, symptoms of the condition include uncharacteristically inappropriate, extreme, or erratic behaviour and moods, hallucinations, anorexia, weight loss, anemia, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, oscillating hypertonia and hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, opisthotonus, pancreatitis, rapid neurological decline, and coma.  In maple syrup urine disease, the brain concentration of branched-chain ketoacids can increase 10- to 20-fold. This leads to a depletion of glutamate and a consequent reduction in the concentration of brain glutamine, aspartate, alanine, and other amino acids. The result is a compromise of energy metabolism because of a failure of the malate-aspartate shuttle and a diminished rate of protein synthesis (PMID: 15930465). 3-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid is a keto-acid, which is a subclass of organic acids. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated MSUD.

It has been detected in red huckleberries, rabbiteye blueberries, and corianders and in a lower concentration in olives, red raspberries, and almonds. In humans, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid is involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis. In particular, the enzyme 4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase uses a polyprenyl diphosphate and 4-hydroxybenzoate to produce diphosphate and 4-hydroxy-3-polyprenylbenzoate. This enzyme participates in ubiquinone biosynthesis. 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid can be biosynthesized by the enzyme Chorismate lyase. Chorismate lyase is an enzyme that transforms chorismate into 4-hydroxybenzoate and pyruvate. This enzyme catalyses the first step in ubiquinone biosynthesis in Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative bacteria. 4-Hydroxybenzoate is an intermediate in many enzyme-mediated reactions in microbes. For instance, the enzyme 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase uses 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, NAD+ and H2O to produce 4-hydroxybenzoate, NADH and H+. This enzyme participates in toluene and xylene degradation in bacteria such as Pseudomonas mendocina. 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase is also found in carrots. The enzyme 4-hydroxybenzoate 1-hydroxylase transforms 4-hydroxybenzoate, NAD(P)H, 2 H+ and O2 into hydroquinone, NAD(P)+, H2O and CO2. This enzyme participates in 2,4-dichlorobenzoate degradation and is found in Candida parapsilosis. The enzyme 4-hydroxybenzoate 3-monooxygenase transforms 4-hydroxybenzoate, NADPH, H+ and O2 into protocatechuate, NADP+ and H2O. This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation and 2,4-dichlorobenzoate degradation and is found in Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas fluorescens. 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid is a popular antioxidant in part because of its low toxicity. 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid has estrogenic activity both in vitro and in vivo (PMID 9417843).",HMDB0000500_nmroned_1394_29582.txt,nmroned,"4-hydroxybenzoic acid 4-carboxyphenol p-hydroxybenzoic acid p-salicylic acid hydroxybenzoic acid hydroxybenzenecarboxylic acid p-hydroxybenzoate p-salicylate hydroxybenzoate hydroxybenzenecarboxylate 4-hydroxybenzoate 4-hydroxy-benzoate 4-hydroxy-benzoesaeure 4-hydroxy-benzoic acid p-carboxyphenol p-hydroxy-benzoate p-hydroxy-benzoic acid paraben-acid 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, calcium salt 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, dilithium salt 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, disodium salt para-hydroxybenzoic acid sodium p-hydroxybenzoate tetrahydrate 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, copper(2+)(1:1) salt 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, dipotassium salt 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, monopotassium salt 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, monosodium salt 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, monosodium salt, 11c-labeled 4-hydroxybenzene carboxylic acid p-hydroxyl benzoic acid 4-hydroxybenzoic acid"

Oxysterols (oxygenated forms of cholesterol) are present at low levels in the circulation and accumulate is plasma and tissues in some pathologies. In atherosclerotic lesions, 7-oxygenated oxysterols, predominantly 7-ketocholesterol, accumulate and have been implicated in the pathology of the disease. There is some in vivo and in vitro evidence that sterol 27-hydroxylase acts on 7-ketocholesterol to initiate its degradation to more polar, water-soluble products. Recent studies indicate an alternative mechanism, in which 7-ketocholesterol is reduced to 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol by 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1. 7-Ketocholesterol can inhibit cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting step in bile acid biosynthesis, as well as strongly inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. It has even been suggested that 7-ketocholesterol is formed enzymically as an endogenous regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis. However, when tested as a pharmacological cholesterol-lowering agent, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase was rapidly overcome and the 7-ketocholesterol metabolised. In vitro, 7-ketocholesterol has wide-ranging and potent effects, most of which have the potential to contribute to atherosclerosis. For example, 7-ketocholesterol can be cytotoxic and can induce apoptosis in vascular cells. These effects, either individually or more likely, in combination, all implicate 7-ketocholesterol in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis, but further work is needed to establish whether or not its role is a direct causal one. 7-Ketocholesterol is the second most abundant oxysterol found in human atherosclerotic plaque, after the enzymically formed 27-hydroxycholesterol (cholest-5-ene-3beta,27-diol). 7-Ketocholesterol differs from cholesterol by a ketone functional group present at the 7-position. It is produced from cholesterol via the epimeric cholesterol 7-hydroperoxides (cholest-5-ene-3beta-ol-7-hydroperoxide) which decompose to the epimeric 7-hydroxycholesterols (cholest-5-ene-3beta,7-diol) and 7-ketocholesterol. 7-Ketocholesterol is a major dietary oxysterol. It has also been widely suggested that 7-ketocholesterol present in atherosclerotic tissue may be derived from the diet. Certainly, 7-ketocholesterol is a major oxysterol found in cholesterol-rich processed foodstuffs. Dietary 7-ketocholesterol is rapidly metabolised by the liver to 7beta-hydroxycholesterol (cholest-5-ene-3beta,7beta-diol), unusual bile acids and perhaps even cholesterol itself. Its conversion to 7beta-hydroxycholesterol is well documented.

N-acyl-alpha amino acids are compounds containing an alpha amino acid which bears an acyl group at its terminal nitrogen atom. N-Acetyl-L-phenylalanine can also be classified as an alpha amino acid or a derivatized alpha amino acid. Technically, N-Acetyl-L-phenylalanine is a biologically available N-terminal capped form of the proteinogenic alpha amino acid L-phenylalanine. N-acetyl amino acids can be produced either via direct synthesis of specific N-acetyltransferases or via the proteolytic degradation of N-acetylated proteins by specific hydrolases. N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a widespread and highly conserved process in eukaryotes that is involved in protection and stability of proteins (PMID: 16465618).  About 85% of all human proteins and 68% of all yeast proteins are acetylated at their N-terminus (PMID: 21750686). Several proteins from prokaryotes and archaea are also modified by N-terminal acetylation. The majority of eukaryotic N-terminal-acetylation reactions occur through N-acetyltransferase enzymes or NAT‚Äôs (PMID: 30054468).  These enzymes consist of three main oligomeric complexes NatA, NatB, and NatC, which are composed of at least a unique catalytic subunit and one unique ribosomal anchor. The substrate specificities of different NAT enzymes are mainly determined by the identities of the first two N-terminal residues of the target protein. The human NatA complex co-translationally acetylates N-termini that bear a small amino acid (A, S, T, C, and occasionally V and G) (PMID: 30054468). NatA also exists in a monomeric state and can post-translationally acetylate acidic N-termini residues (D-, E-). NatB and NatC acetylate N-terminal methionine with further specificity determined by the identity of the second amino acid.  N-acetylated amino acids, such as N-acetylphenylalanine can be released by an N-acylpeptide hydrolase from peptides generated by proteolytic degradation (PMID: 16465618). In addition to the NAT enzymes and protein-based acetylation, N-acetylation of free phenylalanine can also occur. In particular, N-Acetyl-L-phenylalanine can be biosynthesized from L-phenylalanine and acetyl-CoA by the enzyme phenylalanine N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.53). N-Acetyl-L-phenylalanine is a potential uremic toxin and is considered as a hazardous amphipathic metabolite of phenylalanine (PMID: 4038506). Many N-acetylamino acids, including N-acetylphenylalanine, are classified as uremic toxins (PMID: 26317986; PMID: 20613759). Uremic toxins are a diverse group of endogenously produced molecules that, if not properly cleared or eliminated by the kidneys, can cause kidney damage, cardiovascular disease and neurological deficits (PMID: 18287557). N-Acetyl-L-phenylalanine appears in large amount in urine of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU), which is a human genetic disorder due to the lack of phenylalanine hydroxylase, the enzyme necessary to metabolize phenylalanine to tyrosine (PMID: 3473611). N-Acetyl-L-phenylalanine is a product of enzyme phenylalanine N-acetyltransferase [EC 2.3.1.53] which is found in the phenylalanine metabolism pathway.

These are alpha amino acids which have the L-configuration of the alpha-carbon atom. Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. L-asparagine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Arginine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals. Arginine is an essential amino acid that is physiologically active in the L-form. It is classified as a charged, basic, aliphatic amino acid. Arginine is considered to be a basic amino acid as it has a strongly basic guanidinium group. With a pKa of 12.48, the guanidinium group is positively charged in neutral, acidic, and even most basic environments. Because of the conjugation between the double bond and the nitrogen lone pairs, the positive charge is delocalized. This group is able to form multiple H-bonds. In mammals, arginine is formally classified as a semi-essential or conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual. Infants are unable to effectively synthesize arginine, making it nutritionally essential for infants. Adults, however, are able to synthesize arginine in the urea cycle. L-Arginine is an amino acid that has numerous functions in the body. It helps dispose of ammonia, is used to make compounds such as nitric oxide, creatine, L-glutamate, and L-proline, and it can be converted into glucose and glycogen if needed. Arginine also plays an important role in cell division, immunity and wound healing. Arginine is the immediate precursor of nitric oxide (NO), an important signaling molecule which can act as a second messenger, as well as an intercellular messenger which regulates vasodilation, and also has functions in the immune system's reaction to infection. Nitric oxide is made via the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (PMID 10690324). Arginine is also a precursor for several important nitrogen-containing compounds including urea, ornithine, and agmatine. Arginine is necessary for the synthesis of creatine and can be used for the synthesis of polyamines (mainly through ornithine and to a lesser degree through agmatine, citrulline, and glutamate.) The presence of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in serum or plasma, a close relative of argninine, inhibits the nitric oxide synthase reaction. ADMA is considered a marker for vascular disease, just as L-arginine is considered a sign of a healthy endothelium. In large doses, L-arginine also stimulates the release of the hormones growth hormone and prolactin. Arginine is a known inducer of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and is responsible for inducing protein synthesis through the mTOR pathway. mTOR inhibition by rapamycin partially reduces arginine-induced protein synthesis (PMID: 20841502). Catabolic disease states such as sepsis, injury, and cancer cause an increase in arginine utilization, which can exceed normal body production, leading to arginine depletion. Arginine also activates AMP kinase (AMPK) which then stimulates skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and muscle glucose uptake, thereby increasing insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells (PMID: 21311355).

Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g. membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues (PMID: 11316487, 16037564, 12576301, 11907135).

N-acyl-alpha amino acids are compounds containing an alpha amino acid which bears an acyl group at its terminal nitrogen atom. N-Acetylglycine can also be classified as an alpha amino acid or a derivatized alpha amino acid. Technically, N-Acetylglycine is a biologically available N-terminal capped form of the proteinogenic alpha amino acid glycine. N-acetyl amino acids can be produced either via direct synthesis of specific N-acetyltransferases or via the proteolytic degradation of N-acetylated proteins by specific hydrolases. N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a widespread and highly conserved process in eukaryotes that is involved in protection and stability of proteins (PMID: 16465618).  About 85% of all human proteins and 68% of all yeast proteins are acetylated at their N-terminus (PMID: 21750686). Several proteins from prokaryotes and archaea are also modified by N-terminal acetylation. The majority of eukaryotic N-terminal-acetylation reactions occur through N-acetyltransferase enzymes or NAT‚Äôs (PMID: 30054468).  These enzymes consist of three main oligomeric complexes NatA, NatB, and NatC, which are composed of at least a unique catalytic subunit and one unique ribosomal anchor. The substrate specificities of different NAT enzymes are mainly determined by the identities of the first two N-terminal residues of the target protein. The human NatA complex co-translationally acetylates N-termini that bear a small amino acid (A, S, T, C, and occasionally V and G) (PMID: 30054468). NatA also exists in a monomeric state and can post-translationally acetylate acidic N-termini residues (D-, E-). NatB and NatC acetylate N-terminal methionine with further specificity determined by the identity of the second amino acid.  N-acetylated amino acids, such as N-acetylglycine can be released by an N-acylpeptide hydrolase from peptides generated by proteolytic degradation (PMID: 16465618). In addition to the NAT enzymes and protein-based acetylation, N-acetylation of free glycine can also occur. In particular, N-Acetylglycine can be biosynthesized from glycine and acetyl-CoA by the enzyme glycine N-acyltransferase (GLYAT) (EC 2.3.1.13). Excessive amounts N-acetyl amino acids including N-acetylglycine (as well as N-acetylserine, N-acetylglutamine, N-acetylglutamate, N-acetylalanine, Nacetylmethionine and smaller amounts of N-acetylthreonine, N-acetylleucine, N-acetylvaline and N-acetylisoleucine) can be detected in the urine with individuals with acylase I deficiency, a genetic disorder (PMID: 16465618). Aminoacylase I is a soluble homodimeric zinc binding enzyme that catalyzes the formation of free aliphatic amino acids from N-acetylated precursors. In humans, Aminoacylase I is encoded by the aminoacylase 1 gene (ACY1) on chromosome 3p21 that consists of 15 exons (OMIM 609924). Individuals with aminoacylase I deficiency will experience convulsions, hearing loss and difficulty feeding (PMID: 16465618). ACY1 can also catalyze the reverse reaction, the synthesis of acetylated amino acids. Many N-acetylamino acids, including N-acetylglycine, are classified as uremic toxins if present in high abundance in the serum or plasma (PMID: 26317986; PMID: 20613759). Uremic toxins are a diverse group of endogenously produced molecules that, if not properly cleared or eliminated by the kidneys, can cause kidney damage, cardiovascular disease and neurological deficits (PMID: 18287557).",HMDB0000532_nmroned_1408_29664.txt,nmroned,acetylglycine ac-gly-oh acetamidoacetic acid aceturic acid acetylamino-acetic acid acetylaminoacetic acid ethanoylaminoethanoic acid acetamidoacetate acetate acetic acid acetylamino-acetate acetylaminoacetate ethanoylaminoethanoate 15n-acetylglycine a-radical 2-acetamidoacetate 2-acetamidoacetic acid ac gly aceturate acetylglycocoll n-acetyl-glycine n-acetylglycine n-acetylglycine sodium salt acetylglycinate acetylglycine

Caproic acid is one of the chemicals that gives the decomposing fleshy seed coat of the ginkgo fruit its characteristic unpleasant odor. It is also one of the components of vanilla and cheese. Industrially, the primary use of caproic acid is in the manufacture of its esters for use as artificial flavors and in the manufacture of hexyl derivatives, such as hexylphenols.

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylcholine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphocholines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PC(16:0/16:0), in particular, consists of two chains of palmitic acid at the C-1 and C-2 positions. The palmitic acid moieties are derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is the major constituent of pulmonary surfactant. It is also used for research purposes in studying liposomes, lipid bilayers, and model biological membranes. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol.

Galactose dehydrogenase is responsible for converting galactose to galactonolactone, which then spontaneously or enzymatically converts to galactonic acid. Once formed, galactonic acid may enter the pentose phosphate pathway. Galactonic acid is increased in red blood cells of galactosemic patients, due to a galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) deficiency (PMID: 14680973, OMMBID: The Online Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease, Ch.72). When present in sufficiently high levels, galactonic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of galactonic acid are associated with at least two inborn errors of metabolism, including galactosemia and galactosemia type II. Galactonic acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, liver abnormalities (jaundice), kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated galactosemia. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. High levels of galactonic acid in infants are specifically associated with hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver), cirrhosis, renal failure, cataracts, vomiting, seizure, hypoglycemia, lethargy, brain damage, and ovarian failure.",HMDB0000565_nmroned_1422_29806.txt,nmroned,"galactonic acid d-galactonic acid d-galactonate galactonate galactonic acid, (d)-isomer galactonic acid, monopotassium salt galactonic acid, (l)-isomer"

In addition, transaldolase deficiency, another defect in the PPP, has been diagnosed in a patient with mainly liver problems among others.

It is thought that D-arabitol is a metabolic end-product in humans. The strong brain-CSF-plasma gradient of polyols in the patient with RPI deficiency suggested a primary metabolic disorder.

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. L-alanine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Cysteine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as an aliphatic, non-polar, sulfur-containing amino acid. Cysteine is an important source of sulfur in human metabolism, and although it is classified as a non-essential amino acid, cysteine may be essential for infants, the elderly, and individuals with certain metabolic disease or who suffer from malabsorption syndromes. Cysteine can occasionally be considered as an essential or conditionally essential amino acid. Cysteine is unique amongst the twenty natural amino acids as it contains a thiol group. Thiol groups can undergo oxidation/reduction (redox) reactions; when cysteine is oxidized it can form cystine, which is two cysteine residues joined by a disulfide bond. This reaction is reversible since the reduction of this disulphide bond regenerates two cysteine molecules. The disulphide bonds of cystine are crucial to defining the structures of many proteins. Cysteine is often involved in electron-transfer reactions, and help the enzyme catalyze its reaction. Cysteine is also part of the antioxidant glutathione. N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is a form of cysteine where an acetyl group is attached to cysteine's nitrogen atom and is sold as a dietary supplement. Cysteine is named after cystine, which comes from the Greek word kustis meaning bladder (cystine was first isolated from kidney stones). Oxidation of cysteine can produce a disulfide bond with another thiol and further oxidation can produce sulphfinic or sulfonic acids. The cysteine thiol group is also a nucleophile and can undergo addition and substitution reactions. Thiol groups become much more reactive when they are ionized, and cysteine residues in proteins have pKa values close to neutrality, so they are often in their reactive thiolate form in the cell. The thiol group also has a high affinity for heavy metals and proteins containing cysteine will bind metals such as mercury, lead, and cadmium tightly. Due to this ability to undergo redox reactions, cysteine has antioxidant properties. Cysteine is important in energy metabolism. As cystine, it is a structural component of many tissues and hormones. Cysteine has clinical uses ranging from treating baldness to psoriasis to preventing smoker's hack. In some cases, oral cysteine therapy has proved excellent for treatment of asthmatics, enabling them to stop theophylline and other medications. Cysteine also enhances the effect of topically applied silver, tin, and zinc salts in preventing dental cavities. In the future, cysteine may play a role in the treatment of cobalt toxicity, diabetes, psychosis, cancer, and seizures (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/).

These are organic compounds containing exactly two carboxylic acid groups. Glutaconic acid is soluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Glutaconic acid has been detected in the urine of individuals with inborn errors of metabolism. When present in sufficiently high levels, glutaconic acid can act as an acidogen, a neurotoxin, and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A neurotoxin is a compound that is toxic to neural tissues and cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of glutaconic acid are associated with glutaric aciduria type I (glutaric acidemia type I, glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, GA1, or GAT1). GA1 is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to completely break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan due to a deficiency of mitochondrial glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.7, GCDH). Excessive levels of their intermediate breakdown products (e.g. glutaric acid, glutaryl-CoA, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaconic acid) can accumulate and cause damage to the brain (and also other organs), but particularly the basal ganglia. GA1 is associated with a risk for intracranial and retinal hemorrhage, and non-specific white matter changes. Babies with glutaric acidemia type I are often born with unusually large heads (macrocephaly). Other symptoms include spasticity (increased muscle tone/stiffness) and dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions resulting in abnormal movement or posture), but many affected individuals are asymptomatic. Seizures and coma (encephalopathy) are rare. GA1 also causes secondary carnitine deficiency because 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, like other organic acids, is detoxified by carnitine. Glutaconic acid's neurotoxicity is thought to be partially caused by an excitotoxic mechanism in which glutaconic acid overactivates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors.

A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Ethylmalonic acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures.",HMDB0000622_nmroned_1440_29992.txt,nmroned,"ethylmalonic acid 1,1-propanedicarboxylic acid 2-ethylmalonic acid alpha-carboxybutyric acid 1,1-propanedicarboxylate 2-ethylmalonate a-carboxybutyrate a-carboxybutyric acid alpha-carboxybutyrate α-carboxybutyrate α-carboxybutyric acid ethylmalonate ethyl-malonic acid 2-ethylpropanedioic acid ethylmalonic acid"

Gluconic acid belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sugar acids and derivatives. Sugar acids and derivatives are compounds containing a saccharide unit which bears a carboxylic acid group. In aqueous solution, gluconic acid exists in equilibrium with the cyclic ester glucono delta-lactone. Gluconic acid occurs naturally in fruit, honey, kombucha tea and wine. The salts of gluconic acid are known as ""gluconates"". Gluconic acid, gluconate salts, and gluconate esters occur widely in nature because such species arise from the oxidation of glucose. Gluconic acid exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. The metabolism of gluconate is well characterized in prokaryotes where it is known to be degraded following phosphorylation by gluconokinase. Glucokinase activity has also been detected in mammals, including humans (PMID: 24896608). Gluconic acid is produced in the gluconate shunt pathway. In the gluconate shunt, glucose is oxidized by glucose dehydrogenase (also called glucose oxidase) to furnish gluconate, the form in which D-gluconic acid is present at physiological pH. Subsequently, gluconate is phosphorylated by the action of gluconate kinase to produce 6-phosphogluconate, which is the second intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway. This gluconate shunt is mainly found in plants, algae, cyanobacteria and some bacteria, which all use the Entner‚ÄìDoudoroff pathway to degrade glucose or gluconate; this generates 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate-6-phosphate, which is then cleaved to generate pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Glucose dehydrogenase and gluconate kinase activities are also present in mammals, fission yeast, and flies. Gluconic acid has many industrial uses. It is used as a drug as part of electrolyte supplementation in total parenteral nutrition. It is also used in cleaning products where it helps cleaning up mineral deposits. Gluconic acid or Gluconic acid is used to maintain the cation-anion balance on electrolyte solutions. In humans, gluconic acid is involved in the metabolic disorder called the transaldolase deficiency. Gluconic acid has been found to be a metabolite in Aspergillus (Hugo Vanden Bossche, D.W.R.

It facilitates fat absorption and cholesterol excretion. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in the bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, and depends only on the presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine, and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH, and consequently require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g. membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues (PMID: 11316487, 16037564, 12576301, 11907135). When present in sufficiently high levels, deoxycholic acid can act as a hepatotoxin, a metabotoxin, and an oncometabolite. A hepatotoxin causes damage to the liver or liver cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. An oncometabolite is a compound, when present at chronically high levels, that promotes tumour growth and survival. Among the primary bile acids, cholic acid is considered to be the least hepatotoxic while deoxycholic acid is the most hepatoxic (PMID: 1641875). The liver toxicity of bile acids appears to be due to their ability to peroxidate lipids and to lyse liver cells. High bile acid levels lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, disruption of the cell membrane and mitochondria, induction of DNA damage, mutation and apoptosis, and the development of reduced apoptosis capability upon chronic exposure (PMID: 24884764). Chronically high levels of deoxycholic acid are associated with familial hypercholanemia. In hypercholanemia, bile acids, including deoxycholic acid, are elevated in the blood. This disease causes liver damage, extensive itching, poor fat absorption, and can lead to rickets due to lack of calcium in bones. The deficiency of normal bile acids in the intestines results in a deficiency of vitamin K, which also adversely affects clotting of the blood. The bile acid ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid) can improve symptoms associated with familial hypercholanemia.

Cytosine is also classified as a pyrimidine derivative, with a heterocyclic aromatic ring and two substituents attached (an amine group at position 4 and a keto group at position 2). Cytosine is one of the four main bases found in DNA and RNA, along with adenine, guanine, and thymine (uracil in RNA). The nucleoside of cytosine is cytidine. In Watson-Crick base pairing, cytosine forms three hydrogen bonds with guanine. Cytosine was discovered and named by Albrecht Kossel and Albert Neumann in 1894 when it was hydrolyzed from calf thymus tissues. Cytosine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Within cells, cytosine can undergo several enzymatic reactions. It can be methylated into 5-methylcytosine by an enzyme called DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) or be methylated and hydroxylated to make 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. The DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) family of enzymes transfer a methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) to the 5‚Äô carbon of cytosine in a molecule of DNA.

These are keto acids with 6 to 12 carbon atoms. Succinylacetone is soluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Succinylacetone has been detected in amniotic fluid, blood, and urine. Within the cell, succinylacetone is primarily located in the cytoplasm (predicted from logP). Succinylacetone can be created by the oxidation of glycine, and is a precursor of methylglyoxal (Wikipedia). Succinylacetone is an abnormal tyrosine metabolite that arises from defects in the enzyme called fumarylacetoacetase (PMID: 16448836). Fumarylacetoacetase normally catalyzes the hydrolysis of 4-fumarylacetoacetate into fumarate and acetoacetate. If present in sufficiently high levels, succinylacetone can act as an acidogen, an oncometabolite, and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. An oncometabolite is an endogenous metabolite that causes cancer. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of succinylacetone are associated with tyrosinemia type I. Type I tyrosinemia is an inherited metabolism disorder due to a shortage of the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase that is needed to break down tyrosine. Patients usually develop features such as hepatic necrosis, renal tubular injury, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Neurologic and dermatologic manifestations are also possible. The urine has an odour of cabbage or rancid butter. Succinylacetone is a keto-acid, which is a subclass of organic acids. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated tyrosinemia. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. Succinylacetone appears to function as an oncometabolite (similar in function to succinate, another oncometabolite) as patients with high levels of this compound often develop hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 20003495).",HMDB0000635_nmroned_1448_30076.txt,nmroned,"succinylacetone 4,6-dioxoheptanoate 4,6-dioxoheptanoic acid succinylacetone"

Levoglucosan in urine has been shown to be highly correlated with regional fires and as a biomarker for wood smoke exposure (PMID: 19165390). This is because the gas emitted by the pyrolysis of wood (biomass) contains significant amounts of levoglucosan. The hydrolysis of levoglucosan generates the fermentable sugar glucose, and therefore lignocellulosic material exhibits great potential as a renewable feedstock for the production of bioethanol. Levoglucosan can also be utilized in the synthesis of chiral polymers such as unhydrolysable glucose polymers. Levoglucosan is also produced via caramelization of sugar.

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. Structurally, glutamine is similar to the amino acid glutamic acid. However, instead of having a terminal carboxylic acid, it has an amide. Glutamine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Glutamine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as an aliphatic, polar amino acid.  In humans glutamine is considered a non-essential amino acid. Enzymatically, glutamine is formed by replacing a side-chain hydroxyl of glutamic acid with an amine functional group. More specifically, glutamine is synthesized by the enzyme glutamine synthetase from glutamate and ammonia. The most relevant glutamine-producing tissue are skeletal muscles, accounting for about 90% of all glutamine synthesized. Glutamine is also released, in small amounts, by the lungs and brain. In human blood, glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid. Dietary sources of glutamine include protein-rich foods such as beef, chicken, fish, dairy products, eggs, beans, beets, cabbage, spinach, carrots, parsley, vegetable juices, wheat, papaya, Brussels sprouts, celery and kale. Glutamine is one of the few amino acids that can directly cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Glutamine is often used as a supplement in weightlifting, bodybuilding, endurance and other sports, as well as by those who suffer from muscular cramps or pain, particularly elderly people. In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved L-glutamine oral powder, marketed as Endari, to reduce severe complications of sickle cell disease in people aged five years and older with the disorder. Subjects who were treated with L-glutamine oral powder experienced fewer hospital visits for pain treated with a parenterally administered narcotic or ketorolac. The main use of glutamine within the diet of either group is as a means of replenishing the body's stores of amino acids that have been used during exercise or everyday activities. Studies which have looked into problems with excessive consumption of glutamine thus far have proved inconclusive. However, normal supplementation is healthy mainly because glutamine is supposed to be supplemented after prolonged periods of exercise (for example, a workout or exercise in which amino acids are required for use) and replenishes amino acid stores. This is one of the main reasons glutamine is recommended during fasting or for people who suffer from physical trauma, immune deficiencies, or cancer. There is a significant body of evidence that links glutamine-enriched diets with positive intestinal effects. These include maintenance of gut barrier function, aiding intestinal cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as generally reducing septic morbidity and the symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). The reason for such ""cleansing"" properties is thought to stem from the fact that the intestinal extraction rate of glutamine is higher than that for other amino acids, and is therefore thought to be the most viable option when attempting to alleviate conditions relating to the gastrointestinal tract. These conditions were discovered after comparing plasma concentration within the gut between glutamine-enriched and non glutamine-enriched diets. However, even though glutamine is thought to have ""cleansing"" properties and effects, it is unknown to what extent glutamine has clinical benefits, due to the varied concentrations of glutamine in varieties of food. It is also known that glutamine has positive effects in reducing healing time after operations. Hospital waiting times after abdominal surgery are reduced by providing parenteral nutrition regimens containing amounts of glutamine to patients. Clinical trials have revealed that patients on supplementation regimes containing glutamine have improved nitrogen balances, generation of cysteinyl-leukotrienes from polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes and improved lymphocyte recovery and intestinal permeability (in postoperative patients) - in comparison to those who had no glutamine within their dietary regime; all without any side-effects.

An aldopentose is a monosaccharide containing five carbon atoms, including an aldehyde (CHO) functional group. Arabinose gets its name from gum arabic, from which it was first isolate. Most saccharides found in nature are in the ""D""-form, however, L-arabinose is in fact more common than D-arabinose. L-arabinose is found in nature as a component of biopolymers such as hemicellulose and pectin. L-arabinose is found in all organisms from bacteria to plants to animals. Arabinose is the second most abundant pentose in lignocellulosic biomass after xylose. There are two different arabinose utilization pathways in nature: bacterial and fungal. The bacterial pathway converts arabinose into xylulose-5-P via ribulose-5-P using three enzymes (L-arabinose isomerase, L-ribulokinase, and L-ribulose-5-P 4-epimerase) after which it enters the pentose phosphate pathway for ethanol production. The fungal pathway converts arabinose into L-arabinitol by aldose reductase (AR) or XR, L-xylulose by L-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase (LAD), xylitol by L-xylulose reductase (LXR), D-xylulose by xylulose dehydrogenase (XDH), and D-xylulose-5-P by xylulose kinase (XK), and lastly enters the nonoxidative pentose phosphate pathway for further metabolism.  Arabinose has a sweet taste and is one of the most abundant components released by complete hydrolysis of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) of vegetable origin. Although widely present in nature, L-arabinose is rarely used in food production or food flavoring, and its physiological effects in vivo have received little attention. L-arabinose is known to selectively inhibit intestinal sucrase activity in a non-competitive manner. Sucrase is the enzyme that breaks down sucrose into glucose and fructose in the small intestine. As a result, L-arabinose suppresses plasma glucose increase due to sucrose ingestion. The presence of arabinose in urine may indicate overgrowth of intestinal yeast such as Candida albicans or other yeast/fungus species.

More specifically, it is a decanoic acid ester of carnitine. Acylcarnitines were first discovered in the 1940s (PMID: 13825279 ). It is believed that there are more than 1000 types of acylcarnitines in the human body. The general role of acylcarnitines is to transport acyl-groups (organic acids and fatty acids) from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria so that they can be broken down to produce energy.  This process is known as beta-oxidation. According to a recent review [Dambrova et al. 2021, Physiological Reviews], acylcarnitines (ACs) can be classified into 9 different categories depending on the type and size of their acyl-group: 1) short-chain ACs; 2) medium-chain ACs; 3) long-chain ACs; 4) very long-chain ACs; 5) hydroxy ACs; 6) branched chain ACs; 7) unsaturated ACs; 8) dicarboxylic ACs and 9) miscellaneous ACs. Short-chain ACs have acyl-groups with two to five carbons (C2-C5), medium-chain ACs have acyl-groups with six to thirteen carbons (C6-C13), long-chain ACs have acyl-groups with fourteen to twenty once carbons (C14-C21) and very long-chain ACs have acyl groups with more than 22 carbons. Decanoylcarnitine is therefore classified as a medium chain AC. As a medium-chain acylcarnitine decanoylcarnitine is somewhat less abundant than short-chain acylcarnitines. These are formed either through esterification with L-carnitine or through the peroxisomal metabolism of longer chain acylcarnitines (PMID: 30540494 ). Many medium-chain acylcarnitines can serve as useful markers for inherited disorders of fatty acid metabolism. In particular decanoylcarnitine is elevated in the blood or plasma of individuals with obesity in adolescence  (PMID: 26910390 ). It is also decreased in the blood or plasma of individuals with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (PMID: 26928931 ). Carnitine octanoyltransferase (CrOT, EC:2.3.1.137) is responsible for the synthesis of all medium-chain (MCAC, C5-C12) and medium-length branched-chain acylcarnitines in peroxisomes (PMID: 10486279 ). The study of acylcarnitines is an active area of research and it is likely that many novel acylcarnitines will be discovered in the coming years. It is also likely that many novel roles in health and disease will be uncovered. An excellent review of the current state of knowledge for acylcarnitines is available at [Dambrova et al. 2021, Physiological Reviews].

Accumulation of cholesterol sulfate in the skin is implicated in the pathophysiology of X-linked ichthyosis, a congenital disorder in which STS is non-functional and the body cannot convert cholesterol sulfate back into cholesterol. Cholesterol sulfate is quantitatively the most important known sterol sulfate in human plasma, where it is present in a concentration that overlaps that of the other abundant circulating steroid sulfate, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfate (PMID 12730293).

It plays a role in protecting erythrocytes from osmotic lysis and regulating sperm capacitation. Cholesterol sulfate can regulate the activity of serine proteases, e.g., those involved in blood clotting, fibrinolysis, and epidermal cell adhesion (PMID 12730293). As a result of its ability to regulate the activity of selective protein kinase C isoforms and modulate the specificity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, cholesterol sulfate is involved in signal transduction (PMID 12730293).

Pure fructose has a sweet taste similar to cane sugar, but with a ""fruity"" aroma. Pure, dry fructose is a sweet, white, odorless, crystalline solid, and is the most water-soluble of all the sugars. Although fructose is a hexose (6-carbon sugar), it generally exists as a 5-member hemiketal ring (a furanose). This structure is responsible for the long metabolic pathway and high reactivity compared to glucose. Fructose is a reducing sugar, as are all monosaccharides. Fructose is found in many foods including honey, tree fruits, berries, melons, and some root vegetables, such as beets, sweet potatoes, parsnips, and onions. Commercially, fructose is derived from sugar cane, sugar beets, and maize. Fructose is also derived from the digestion of sucrose, a disaccharide consisting of glucose and fructose that is broken down by enzymes during digestion. Fructose is the sweetest naturally occurring sugar, estimated to be twice as sweet as sucrose. It is used as a preservative and an intravenous infusion in parenteral feeding. Excessive consumption of fructose (especially from sugar-sweetened beverages) may contribute to insulin resistance, obesity, elevated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, leading to metabolic syndrome (PMID: 26429086). Fructose exists in foods either as a monosaccharide (free fructose) or as a unit of a disaccharide (sucrose). Free fructose is absorbed directly by the intestine. When fructose is consumed in the form of sucrose, it is digested (broken down) and then absorbed as free fructose. As sucrose comes into contact with the membrane of the small intestine, the enzyme sucrase catalyzes the cleavage of sucrose to yield one glucose unit and one fructose unit, which are then each absorbed. After absorption, it enters the hepatic portal vein and is directed toward the liver. fructose absorption occurs on the mucosal membrane via facilitated transport involving GLUT5 transport proteins. Since the concentration of fructose is higher in the lumen, fructose is able to flow down a concentration gradient into the enterocytes, assisted by transport proteins. Fructose may be transported out of the enterocyte across the basolateral membrane by either GLUT2 or GLUT5, although the GLUT2 transporter has a greater capacity for transporting fructose, and, therefore, the majority of fructose is transported out of the enterocyte through GLUT2. The catabolism of fructose is sometimes referred to as fructolysis. In fructolysis, the enzyme fructokinase produces fructose 1-phosphate, which is split by aldolase B to produce the trioses dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde.  Unlike glycolysis, in fructolysis the triose glyceraldehyde lacks a phosphate group. A third enzyme, triokinase, is therefore required to phosphorylate glyceraldehyde, producing glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The resulting trioses can enter the gluconeogenic pathway for glucose or glycogen synthesis, or be further catabolized through the lower glycolytic pathway to pyruvate. Fructose metabolism leads to significant increases of plasma uric acid levels (PMID: 28420204). In fructolysis, fructose 1-phosphate accumulates, and intracellular phosphate decreases. This decrease stimulates AMP deaminase (AMPD), which catalyzes the degradation of AMP to inosine monophosphate, increasing the rate of purine degradation (PMID: 28420204). The purine degradation produces uric acid and generates mitochondrial oxidants. Mitochondrial oxidative stress then induces aconitase inhibition in the Krebs cycle, with accumulation of citrate and stimulation of ATP citrate lyase and fatty acid synthase (PMID: 28420204). The result is de novo lipogenesis and hepatic fat accumulation. Physiologically, the increase in intracellular uric acid is followed by an acute rise in circulating levels of uric acid, which is likely due to its release from the liver. Fructose also stimulates uric acid synthesis from amino acid precursors such as glycine. Moreover, long-term fructose administration suppresses renal excretion of uric acid, resulting in elevated serum uric acid levels.",HMDB0000660_nmroned_1460_30200.txt,nmroned,"d-fructose beta-d-arabino-hexulose beta-d-fructose beta-fruit sugar beta-levulose fructose b-d-arabino-hexulose β-d-arabino-hexulose b-d-fructose β-d-fructose b-fruit sugar β-fruit sugar b-levulose β-levulose beta-d-fructofuranose beta-delta-arabino-hexulose beta-delta-fructofuranose beta-delta-fructose d-(-)-fructose delta-(-)-fructose delta-fructose fru fructon levulose braun brand of fructose fleboplast levulosa fresenius kabi brand of fructose instituto farmacologico brand of fructose levulosa levulosa ife grifols brand of fructose levulosa baxter levulosado braun ern brand of fructose levulosa grifols levulosa mein levulosado vitulia apir levulosa baxter brand of fructose bieffe brand of fructose levulosa braun levulosa ibys levulosa, apir levulosa, fleboplast levulosado bieffe medit plast apyr levulosa mein"

Glutaric acid is naturally produced in the body during the metabolism of some amino acids, including lysine and tryptophan. Glutaric acid may cause irritation to the skin and eyes. When present in sufficiently high levels, glutaric acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of glutaric acid are associated with at least three inborn errors of metabolism, including glutaric aciduria type I, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency, and glutaric aciduria type III. Glutaric aciduria type I (glutaric acidemia type I, glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, GA1, or GAT1) is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to completely break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan due to a deficiency of mitochondrial glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.7, GCDH). Excessive levels of their intermediate breakdown products (e.g. glutaric acid, glutaryl-CoA, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaconic acid) can accumulate and cause damage to the brain (and also other organs). Babies with glutaric acidemia type I are often born with unusually large heads (macrocephaly). Macrocephaly is amongst the earliest signs of GA1. GA1 also causes secondary carnitine deficiency because glutaric acid, like other organic acids, is detoxified by carnitine. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated glutaric aciduria. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures. Treatment of glutaric aciduria is mainly based on the restriction of lysine intake, supplementation of carnitine, and an intensification of therapy during intercurrent illnesses. The major principle of dietary treatment is to reduce the production of glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid by restriction of natural protein, in general, and of lysine, in particular (PMID: 17465389, 15505398).

Leucinic acid has been found in a patient with dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (DLD) deficiency (PMID: 6688766). DLD deficiency is caused by mutations in the DLD gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. A common feature of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency is a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in tissues (lactic acidosis), which can cause nausea, vomiting, severe breathing problems, and an abnormal heartbeat. Neurological problems are also common in this condition; the first symptoms in affected infants are often decreased muscle tone (hypotonia) and extreme tiredness (lethargy). As the problems worsen, affected infants can have difficulty feeding, decreased alertness, and seizures. Liver problems can also occur in dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency, ranging from an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) to life-threatening liver failure. In some affected people, liver disease, which can begin anytime from infancy to adulthood, is the primary symptom.

It is formed in the liver in a reaction catalyzed by L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) when transferring the amidino group from arginine to lysine. It is an alternative substrate for nitric oxide (NO) synthase. L-homoarginine increases the availability of NO and thereby affects endothelial function. High homoarginine levels may exert positive actions that are relevant to cardiovascular health, including enhanced endothelial function, inhibition of platelet aggregation and stimulation of insulin secretion (PMID: 30866658). Recent studies have demonstrated that low serum homoarginine levels are a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality (PMID: 24583919).

In certain cases the measurement of these metabolites in body fluids can be used to diagnose disorders associated with mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.13) which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction: acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine.

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. L-leucine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Leucine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals. It is classified as a non-polar, uncharged (at physiological pH) aliphatic amino acid. Leucine is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and it must be obtained from the diet. Human dietary sources are foods that contain protein, such as meats, dairy products, soy products, beans and legumes. L-Leucine is a branched chain amino acid (BCAA).  The BCAAs consist of leucine, valine and isoleucine (and occasionally threonine). BCAAs are essential amino acids whose carbon structure is marked by a branch point at the beta-carbon position. BCAAs are critical to human life and are particularly involved in stress, energy and muscle metabolism. BCAA supplementation as therapy, both oral and intravenous, in human health and disease holds great promise. BCAAs have different metabolic routes, with valine going solely to carbohydrates (glucogenic), leucine solely to fats (ketogenic) and isoleucine being both a glucogenic and a ketogenic amino acid. The different metabolism accounts for different requirements for these essential amino acids in humans: 12 mg/kg, 14 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg of valine, leucine and isoleucine respectively. The primary metabolic end products of leucine metabolism are acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate; consequently, it is one of the two exclusively ketogenic amino acids, with lysine being the other. Leucine is the most important ketogenic amino acid in humans. The vast majority of l-leucine metabolism is initially catalyzed by the branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase enzyme, producing alpha-ketoisocaproate (alpha-KIC). alpha-KIC is metabolized by the mitochondrial enzyme branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase, which converts it to isovaleryl-CoA. Isovaleryl-CoA is subsequently metabolized by the enzyme isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase and converted to beta-methylcrotonyl-CoA (MC-CoA), which is used in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA and other compounds. During biotin deficiency, HMB can be synthesized from MC-CoA via enoyl-CoA hydratase and an unknown thioesterase enzyme, which convert MC-CoA into HMB-CoA and HMB-CoA into HMB respectively.  Leucine has the capacity to directly stimulate myofibrillar muscle protein synthesis (PMID 15051860). This effect of leucine arises results from its role as an activator of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) (PMID 23551944) a serine-threonine protein kinase that regulates protein biosynthesis and cell growth. The activation of mTOR by leucine is mediated through Rag GTPases.  Leucine, like other BCAAs, is associated with insulin resistance. In particular, higher levels of leucine are observed in the blood of diabetic mice, rats, and humans (PMID 25287287). BCAAs such as leucine have different deficiency symptoms. Valine deficiency is marked by neurological defects in the brain, while isoleucine deficiency is marked by muscle tremors. Persistently low leucine levels can result in decreased appetite, poor feeding, lethargy, poor growth, weight loss, skin rashes, hair loss, and desquamation. Many types of inborn errors of BCAA metabolism exist and these are marked by various abnormalities. The most common form is maple syrup urine disease, marked by a characteristic urinary odor. Other abnormalities are associated with a wide range of symptoms, such as mental retardation, ataxia, hypoglycemia, spinal muscle atrophy, rash, vomiting and excessive muscle movement. Most forms of BCAA metabolism errors are corrected by dietary restriction of BCAAs and at least one form is correctable by supplementation with 10 mg of biotin daily. - BCAAs are useful because they are metabolized primarily by muscle. Stress states - e.g surgery, trauma, cirrhosis, infections, fever and starvation--require proportionately more BCAAs than other amino acids and probably proportionately more leucine than either valine or isoleucine. BCAAs and other amino acids are frequently fed intravenously (TPN) to malnourished surgical patients and in some cases of severe trauma. BCAAs, particularly leucine, stimulate protein synthesis, increase reutilization of amino acids in many organs and reduce protein breakdown. Furthermore, leucine can be an important source of calories, and is superior as fuel to the ubiquitous intravenous glucose (dextrose). - Leucine also stimulates insulin release, which in turn stimulates protein synthesis and inhibits protein breakdown. These effects are particularly useful in athletic training. Huntington's chorea and anorexic disorders both are characterized by low serum BCAAs. These diseases, as well as forms of Parkinson's, may respond to BCAA therapy.

It is found in all animal tissues and consists of repeating subunits of N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid, and closely related in structure to heparin. It occurs as a proteoglycan (HSPG) in which two or three HS chains are attached to either cell surface components or the extracellular matrix (ECM), where they serve to reinforce cell adhesion (PMID: 27241222). HS synthesis starts with the transfer of xylose from UDP-xylose by the enzyme known as xylosyltransferase (XT) to specific serine residues within the protein core. Attachment of two galactose (Gal) residues by galactosyltransferases I and II (GalTI and GalTII) and glucuronic acid (GlcA) by the enzyme glucuronosyltransferase I (GlcATI) completes the formation of a tetrasaccharide linker. After attachment of the first N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue by the enzyme known as GalNAc Transferase I (GalNAcT-I), elongation of the tetrasaccharide linker is continued by the stepwise addition of GlcA and GlcNAc residues. These are transferred from their respective UDP-sugar nucleotides. HS functions through binding to a variety of protein ligands including interferon gamma, Wnt, antithrombin III, interleukin 8, fibroblast growth factor, endostatin and others. HS thereby regulates a wide range of developmental signaling pathways such as the Wnt, Hedgehog, transforming growth factor-β, and fibroblast growth factor pathways (PMID: 15563523).

In humans, 2-hydroxyglutarate is formed by a hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase whereas in bacteria it is formed by a 2-hydroxyglutarate synthase. L-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid can be converted to alpha-ketoglutaric acid through the action of 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.2). In humans, there are two such enzymes (D2HGDH and L2HGDH). Both the D and L stereoisomers of hydroxyglutaric acid are found in body fluids. L-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid can also be produced via gain-of-function mutations in the cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). IDH is part of the TCA cycle and this compound is generated in high abundance when IDH is mutated. Since L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid is sufficiently similar in structure to 2-oxoglutarate (2OG), it is able to inhibit a range of 2OG-dependent dioxygenases, including histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) and members of the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) hydroxylases. This inhibitory effect leads to alterations in the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated hypoxic response and alterations in gene expression through global epigenetic remodeling. The net effect is that L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid causes a cascading effect that leads genetic perturbations and malignant transformation. Depending on the circumstances, L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid can function as an oncometabolite, a neurotoxin, an acidogen, and a metabotoxin. An oncometabolite is a compound that promotes tumour growth and survival. A neurotoxin is compound that is toxic to neurons or neural tissue. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels.  As an oncometabolite, L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid is a competitive inhibitor of multiple alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, including histone demethylases and the TET family of 5mC hydroxylases. As a result, high levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate lead to genome-wide histone and DNA methylation alterations, which in turn lead to mutations that ultimately cause cancer (PMID: 29038145). As a neurotoxin, L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid mediates its neurotoxicity through activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. L-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid is structurally similar to the excitatory amino acid glutamate and stimulates neurodegeneration by mechanisms similar to glutamate, NMDA, or mitochondrial toxins (PMID: 12153528). As an acidogen, L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid is classified as an alpha hydroxy acid belonging to the general class of compounds known as organic acids. Chronically high levels of L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid are characteristic of the inborn error of metabolism called L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are the symptoms typical of untreated L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures.",HMDB0000694_nmroned_1482_30419.txt,nmroned,l-2-hydroxyglutaric acid (s)-2-hydroxyglutarate (s)-2-hydroxyglutaric acid l-2-hydroxyglutarate (s)-α-hydroxyglutarate (s)-α-hydroxyglutaric acid (s)-alpha-hydroxyglutarate (s)-alpha-hydroxyglutaric acid 2-hydroxy-(s)-pentanedioate 2-hydroxy-(s)-pentanedioic acid 2-hydroxy-l-glutarate 2-hydroxy-l-glutaric acid l-α-hydroxyglutarate l-α-hydroxyglutaric acid l-alpha-hydroxyglutarate l-alpha-hydroxyglutaric acid l-2-hydroxyglutaric acid

Ketoleucine is both a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of ketoleucine are associated with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). MSUD is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), leading to a buildup of the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and their toxic by-products (ketoacids) in the blood and urine. The symptoms of MSUD often show in infancy and lead to severe brain damage if untreated. MSUD may also present later depending on the severity of the disease. If left untreated in older individuals, during times of metabolic crisis, symptoms of the condition include uncharacteristically inappropriate, extreme, or erratic behaviour and moods, hallucinations, anorexia, weight loss, anemia, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, oscillating hypertonia and hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, opisthotonus, pancreatitis, rapid neurological decline, and coma.  In maple syrup urine disease, the brain concentration of branched-chain ketoacids can increase 10- to 20-fold. This leads to a depletion of glutamate and a consequent reduction in the concentration of brain glutamine, aspartate, alanine, and other amino acids. The result is a compromise of energy metabolism because of a failure of the malate-aspartate shuttle and a diminished rate of protein synthesis (PMID: 15930465).",HMDB0000695_nmroned_1483_30431.txt,nmroned,ketoleucine 2-oxo-4-methylpentanoic acid 2-oxoisocaproate 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate 4-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid alpha-ketoisocaproic acid 2-oxo-4-methylpentanoate 2-oxoisocaproic acid 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid 4-methyl-2-oxovalerate a-ketoisocaproate a-ketoisocaproic acid alpha-ketoisocaproate α-ketoisocaproate α-ketoisocaproic acid 2-keto-4-methylvalerate 2-keto-4-methylvaleric acid 2-ketoisocaproate 2-ketoisocaproic acid 2-oxo-4-methylvalerate 2-oxo-4-methylvaleric acid 2-oxoleucine 4-methyl-2-oxo-valerate 4-methyl-2-oxo-valeric acid a-ketoisocapronate a-ketoisocapronic acid a-oxoisocaproate a-oxoisocaproic acid alpha-keto-isocaproate alpha-keto-isocaproic acid alpha-ketoisocapronate alpha-ketoisocapronic acid alpha-oxoisocaproate alpha-oxoisocaproic acid ketoisocaproate ketoisocaproic acid methyloxovalerate methyloxovaleric acid oxoisocaproate oxoisocaproic acid keto-leucine

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. Methionine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Methionine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as an aliphatic, non-polar amino acid. Methionine is an essential amino acid (there are 9 essential amino acids), meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and it must be obtained from the diet. It is required for normal growth and development of humans, other mammals, and avian species. In addition to being a substrate for protein synthesis, methionine is an intermediate in transmethylation reactions, serving as the major methyl group donor in vivo, including the methyl groups for DNA and RNA intermediates. Methionine is a methyl acceptor for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (methionine synthase), the only reaction that allows for the recycling of this form of folate, and is also a methyl acceptor for the catabolism of betaine. Methionine is the metabolic precursor for cysteine. Only the sulfur atom from methionine is transferred to cysteine; the carbon skeleton of cysteine is donated by serine (PMID: 16702340 ). There is a general consensus concerning normal sulfur amino acid (SAA) requirements. WHO recommendations amount to 13 mg/kg per 24 h in healthy adults. This amount is roughly doubled in artificial nutrition regimens. In disease or after trauma, requirements may be altered for methionine, cysteine, and taurine. Although in specific cases of congenital enzyme deficiency, prematurity, or diminished liver function, hypermethioninemia or hyperhomocysteinemia may occur, SAA supplementation can be considered safe in amounts exceeding 2-3 times the minimum recommended daily intake. Apart from some very specific indications (e.g. acetaminophen poisoning) the usefulness of SAA supplementation is not yet established (PMID: 16702341 ). Methionine is known to exacerbate psychopathological symptoms in schizophrenic patients, but there is no evidence of similar effects in healthy subjects. The role of methionine as a precursor of homocysteine is the most notable cause for concern. Acute doses of methionine can lead to acute increases in plasma homocysteine, which can be used as an index of the susceptibility to cardiovascular disease. Sufficiently high doses of methionine can actually result in death. Longer-term studies in adults have indicated no adverse consequences of moderate fluctuations in dietary methionine intake, but intakes higher than 5 times the normal amount resulted in elevated homocysteine levels. These effects of methionine on homocysteine and vascular function are moderated by supplements of vitamins B-6, B-12, C, and folic acid (PMID: 16702346 ). When present in sufficiently high levels, methionine can act as an atherogen and a metabotoxin. An atherogen is a compound that when present at chronically high levels causes atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of methionine are associated with at least ten inborn errors of metabolism, including cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency, homocystinuria, tyrosinemia, galactosemia, homocystinuria-megaloblastic anemia due to defects in cobalamin metabolism, methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase deficiency. Chronically elevated levels of methionine in infants can lead to intellectual disability and other neurological problems, delays in motor skills, sluggishness, muscle weakness, and liver problems. Many individuals with these metabolic disorders tend to develop cardiovascular disease later in life.

It is an intermediate in the breakdown of branched-chain amino acids and propionic acid from the gut. Typically it originates from propionyl-CoA and a defect in the enzyme propionyl carboxylase. This leads to a buildup in propionyl-CoA in the mitochondria.  Such a buildup can lead to a disruption of the esterified CoA:free CoA ratio and ultimately to mitochondrial toxicity. Detoxification of these metabolic end products occurs via the transfer of the propionyl moiety to carnitine-forming propionyl-carnitine, which is then transferred across the inner mitochondrial membrane. 3-Hydroxypropionic acid is then released as the free acid. As an industrial chemical, it is used in the production of various chemicals such as acrylates in industry. When present in sufficiently high levels, 3-hydroxypropionic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of hydroxypropionic acid are associated with many inborn errors of metabolism including biotinidase deficiency, malonic aciduria, methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, methylmalonic aciduria, methylmalonic aciduria due to cobalamin-related disorders, and propionic acidemia. Hydroxypropionic acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. Infants with acidosis have symptoms that include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures. 3-Hydroxypropionic acid is also a microbial metabolite found in Escherichia, Klebsiella and Saccharomyces (PMID: 26360870).",HMDB0000700_nmroned_1486_30455.txt,nmroned,hydroxypropionic acid 3-hydroxy-propanoic acid 3-hydroxypropanoic acid beta-hydroxypropionic acid hydracrylic acid 3-hydroxypropionate 3-hydroxypropionic acid 3-hydroxy-propanoate 3-hydroxypropanoate b-hydroxypropionate b-hydroxypropionic acid beta-hydroxypropionate β-hydroxypropionate β-hydroxypropionic acid hydracrylate hydroxypropionate 2-deoxyglycerate 2-deoxyglyceric acid b-lactate b-lactic acid beta-lactate beta-lactic acid ethylenelactate ethylenelactic acid

Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.13) which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction: acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine. Hippuric acid is a normal component of urine and is typically increased with increased consumption of phenolic compounds (tea, wine, fruit juices). These phenols are converted into benzoic acid which is then converted into hippuric acid and excreted in the urine. Hippuric acid is the most frequently used biomarker in the biological monitoring of occupational exposure to toluene. This product of solvent biotransformation may be also found in the urine of individuals who have not been exposed to the solvent. A smaller fraction of the absorbed toluene is oxidized into aromatic compounds including ortho-cresol, which is not found in the urine of nonexposed individuals in a significant amount. The concentration of hippuric acid in the urine of individuals exposed to a low toluene concentration does not differ from that of individuals not exposed to the solvent. This has led to the conclusion that hippuric acid should not be utilized in the biological monitoring of occupational exposure to low levels of toluene in the air.

KYNA neuroprotective and anticonvulsive activities have been demonstrated in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. Because of KYNA's neuromodulatory character, its involvement has been speculatively linked to the pathogenesis of a number of neurological conditions including those in the ageing process. Different patterns of abnormalities in various stages of KYNA metabolism in the CNS have been reported in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. In HIV-1-infected patients and in patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis a marked rise of KYNA metabolism was seen. In the ageing process KYNA metabolism in the CNS of rats shows a characteristic pattern of changes throughout the life span. A marked increase of the KYNA content in the CNS occurs before the birth, followed by a dramatic decline on the day of birth. A low activity was seen during ontogenesis, and a slow and progressive enhancement occurs during maturation and ageing. This remarkable profile of KYNA metabolism alterations in the mammalian brain has been suggested to result from the development of the organisation of neuronal connections and synaptic plasticity, development of receptor recognition sites, maturation and ageing. There is significant evidence that KYNA can improve cognition and memory, but it has also been demonstrated that it interferes with working memory. Impairment of cognitive function in various neurodegenerative disorders is accompanied by profound reduction and/or elevation of KYNA metabolism. The view that enhancement of CNS KYNA levels could underlie cognitive decline is supported by the increased KYNA metabolism in Alzheimer's disease, by the increased KYNA metabolism in down's syndrome and the enhancement of KYNA function during the early stage of Huntington's disease. Kynurenic acid is the only endogenous N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist identified up to now, that mediates glutamatergic hypofunction. Schizophrenia is a disorder of dopaminergic neurotransmission, but modulation of the dopaminergic system by glutamatergic neurotransmission seems to play a key role. Despite the NMDA receptor antagonism, kynurenic acid also blocks, in lower doses, the nicotinergic acetycholine receptor, i.e., increased kynurenic acid levels can explain psychotic symptoms and cognitive deterioration. Kynurenic acid levels are described to be higher in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in critical central nervous system (CNS) regions of schizophrenics as compared to controls.

Hydroxyproline and proline play key roles in collagen stability. In particular, they permit the sharp twisting of the collagen helix. Hydroxyproline is found in few proteins other than collagen. The only other mammalian protein which includes hydroxyproline is elastin. For this reason, hydroxyproline content has been used as an indicator to determine collagen and/or gelatin amount in tissue or biological samples. Increased serum and urine levels of hydroxyproline have been found in Paget's disease (PMID: 436278). Hydroxyproline (Hyp) content in biological fluids is used as a parameter of collagen catabolism, especially bone resorption or tissue degradation. Bedridden and elderly individuals show significantly elevated serum levels of hydroxyproline in comparison to normal, active individuals (PMID: 10706420). Elevated levels of urinary hydroxyproline are also indicative of muscle damage (PMID: 21988268). Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also known to accelerate collagen degradation.

More specifically, it is an isobutyric acid ester of carnitine. Acylcarnitines were first discovered more than 70 year ago (PMID: 13825279). It is believed that there are more than 1000 types of acylcarnitines in the human body. The general role of acylcarnitines is to transport acyl-groups (organic acids and fatty acids) from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria so that they can be broken down to produce energy.  This process is known as beta-oxidation. According to a recent review [Dambrova et al. 2021, Physiological Reviews], acylcarnitines (ACs) can be classified into 9 different categories depending on the type and size of their acyl-group: 1) short-chain ACs; 2) medium-chain ACs; 3) long-chain ACs; 4) very long-chain ACs; 5) hydroxy ACs; 6) branched chain ACs; 7) unsaturated ACs; 8) dicarboxylic ACs and 9) miscellaneous ACs. Short-chain ACs have acyl-groups with two to five carbons (C2-C5), medium-chain ACs have acyl-groups with six to thirteen carbons (C6-C13), long-chain ACs have acyl-groups with fourteen to twenty once carbons (C14-C21) and very long-chain ACs have acyl groups with more than 22 carbons. Isobutyryl-L-carnitine is therefore classified as a short chain AC. As a short-chain acylcarnitine isobutyryl-L-carnitine is a member of the most abundant group of carnitines in the body, comprising more than 50% of all acylcarnitines quantified in tissues and biofluids (PMID: 31920980). Some short-chain carnitines have been studied as supplements or treatments for a number of diseases, including neurological disorders and inborn errors of metabolism. In particular isobutyryl-L-carnitine is elevated in the blood or plasma of individuals with isobutyryl-coa dehydrogenase deficiency (PMID: 20591710), glutaric aciduria type 2 (PMID: 20591710), ethylmalonic encephalopathy (PMID: 20591710), and gestational diabetes mellitus (PMID: 29626588). It is also decreased in the blood or plasma of individuals with traumatic brain injury (PMID: 23560894). Isobutyryl-L-carnitine is elevated in the urine of individuals with glutaric aciduria type 2 (PMID: 2288224), multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenation deficiency (PMID: 3383426), and acute coronary syndrome (PMID: 30316136). Carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT, EC:2.3.1.7) is responsible for the synthesis of all short-chain and short branched-chain acylcarnitines (PMID: 23485643). The study of acylcarnitines is an active area of research and it is likely that many novel acylcarnitines will be discovered in the coming years. It is also likely that many novel roles in health and disease will be uncovered. An excellent review of the current state of knowledge for acylcarnitines is available at [Dambrova et al. 2021, Physiological Reviews].",HMDB0000736_nmroned_5169_2733423.txt,nmroned,isobutyryl-l-carnitine (r)-isobutyrylcarnitine iso-butyryl-l(-)-carnitin isobutyryl-carnitine isobutyryl-l-(-)-carnitine o-isobutanoyl-(r)-carnitine isobutyryl-1-carnitine isobutyrylcarnitine o-isobutyryl-l-carnitine isobutyryl-l-carnitine

It has a bicyclic structure, consisting of a six-membered benzene ring fused to a five-membered nitrogen-containing pyrrole ring. The participation of the nitrogen lone electron pair in the aromatic ring means that indole is not a base, and it does not behave like a simple amine. Indole is a microbial metabolite and it can be produced by bacteria as a degradation product of the amino acid tryptophan. It occurs naturally in human feces and has an intense fecal smell. At very low concentrations, however, indole has a flowery smell and is a constituent of many flower scents (such as orange blossoms) and perfumes. As a volatile organic compound, indole has been identified as a fecal biomarker of Clostridium difficile infection (PMID: 30986230). Natural jasmine oil, used in the perfume industry, contains around 2.5% of indole. Indole also occurs in coal tar. Indole has been found to be produced in a number of bacterial genera including Alcaligenes, Aspergillus, Escherichia, and Pseudomonas (PMID: 23194589, 2310183, 9680309). Indole plays a role in bacterial biofilm formation, bacterial motility, bacterial virulence, plasmid stability, and antibiotic resistance. It also functions as an intercellular signalling molecule (PMID: 26115989). Recently, it was determined that the bacterial membrane-bound histidine sensor kinase (HK) known as CpxA acts as a bacterial indole sensor to facilitate signalling (PMID: 31164470).

Although its concentration in plasma is only about 10 micromolar (uM), even moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease. Elevations in plasma homocysteine are commonly found as a result of vitamin deficiencies, polymorphisms of enzymes of methionine metabolism, and renal disease. It has been identified as a uremic toxin according to the European Uremic Toxin Working Group (PMID: 22626821). Pyridoxal, folic acid, riboflavin, and vitamin B(12) are all required for methionine metabolism, and deficiency of each of these vitamins result in elevated plasma homocysteine. A polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (C677T), which is quite common in most populations with a homozygosity rate of 10-15 %, is associated with moderate hyperhomocysteinemia, especially in the context of marginal folate intake. Plasma homocysteine is inversely related to plasma creatinine in patients with renal disease. This is due to an impairment in homocysteine removal in renal disease. The role of these factors, and of modifiable lifestyle factors, in affecting methionine metabolism and in determining plasma homocysteine levels is discussed. Homocysteine is an independent cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor modifiable by nutrition and possibly exercise. Homocysteine was first identified as an important biological compound in 1932 and linked with human disease in 1962 when elevated urinary homocysteine levels were found in children with mental retardation. This condition, called homocystinuria, was later associated with premature occlusive CVD, even in children. These observations led to research investigating the relationship of elevated homocysteine levels and CVD in a wide variety of populations including middle age and elderly men and women with and without traditional risk factors for CVD (PMID: 17136938 , 15630149).

It is likely produced from phenylpyruvate via the action of lactate dehydrogenase. The D-form of this organic acid is typically derived from bacterial sources while the L-form is almost certainly endogenous. Levels of phenyllactate are normally very low in blood or urine. High levels of PLA in the urine or blood are often indicative of phenylketonuria (PKU) and hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). PKU is due to lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), so that phenylalanine is converted not to tyrosine but to phenylpyruvic acid (a precursor of phenylactate). In particular, excessive phenylalanine is typically metabolized into phenylketones through, a transaminase pathway route involving glutamate. Metabolites of this transamination reaction include phenylacetate, phenylpyruvate and phenethylamine. In persons with PKU, dietary phenylalanine either accumulates in the body or some of it is converted to phenylpyruvic acid and then to phenyllactate through the action of lactate dehydrogenase. Individuals with PKU tend to excrete large quantities of phenylpyruvate, phenylacetate and phenyllactate, along with phenylalanine, in their urine. If untreated, mental retardation effects and microcephaly are evident by the first year along with other symptoms which include: unusual irritability, epileptic seizures and skin lesions. Hyperactivity, EEG abnormalities and seizures, and severe learning disabilities are major clinical problems later in life. A ""musty or mousy"" odor of skin, hair, sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate accumulation); and a tendency to hypopigmentation and eczema are also observed. The neural-development effects of PKU are primarily due to the disruption of neurotransmitter synthesis. In particular, phenylalanine is a large, neutral amino acid which moves across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via the large neutral amino acid transporter (LNAAT). Excessive phenylalanine in the blood saturates the transporter. Thus, excessive levels of phenylalanine significantly decrease the levels of other LNAAs in the brain. But since these amino acids are required for protein and neurotransmitter synthesis, phenylalanine accumulation disrupts brain development, leading to mental retardation.",HMDB0000748_nmroned_1518_30732.txt,nmroned,l-3-phenyllactic acid (r)-phenyllactate d-3-phenyllactic acid (r)-3-(phenyl)lactate (r)-phenyllactic acid d-3-phenyllactate (r)-3-(phenyl)lactic acid l-3-phenyllactate (-)-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoate (-)-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoic acid (-)-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionate (-)-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionic acid (-)-3-phenyllactate (-)-3-phenyllactic acid (-)-b-phenyllactate (-)-b-phenyllactic acid (-)-beta-phenyllactate (-)-beta-phenyllactic acid (2s)-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoate (2s)-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoic acid (2s)-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionate (2s)-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionic acid (s)-3-phenyl-lactate (s)-3-phenyl-lactic acid (s)-3-phenyllactic acid (s)-a-hydroxy-benzenepropanoate (s)-a-hydroxy-benzenepropanoic acid (s)-alpha-hydroxy-benzenepropanoate (s)-alpha-hydroxy-benzenepropanoic acid (s)-b-phenyllactic (s)-beta-phenyllactic alpha-hydroxy-beta-phenyl-propionic acid hfa l-(-)-3-phenyllactic acid l-2-hydroxy-3-phenyl-propionic acid l-beta-phenyllactic acid l-phenyl lactate phenyllactic acid (r)-3-phenyllactate

It is a byproduct of the leucine degradation pathway. Production of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid begins with the conversion of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA into 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA in the mitochondria by the biotin-dependent enzyme methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase. Biotin deficiencies, certain lifestyle habits (smoking), or specific genetic conditions can reduce methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase activity. This reduction can lead to a buildup of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA, which is converted into 3-hydroxyisovaleryl-CoA by the enzyme enoyl-CoA hydratase. Increased concentrations of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA and 3-hydroxyisovaleryl-CoA can lead to a disruption of the esterified CoA:free CoA ratio, and ultimately to mitochondrial toxicity. Detoxification of these metabolic end products occur via the transfer of the 3-hydroxyisovaleryl moiety to carnitine forming 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid-carnitine or 3HIA-carnitine, which is then transferred across the inner mitochondrial membrane where 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid is released as the free acid (PMID: 21918059). 3-Hydroxyisovaleric acid has been found to be elevated in smokers and in subjects undergoing long-term anticonvulsant therapy with carbamazepine and/or phenytoin. These levels are elevated due to impairment of renal reclamation of biotin. Levels may also be increased from prolonged consumption of raw egg-whites (PMID: 16895887, 9523856, 15447901, 9176832) (OMIM: 210210, 253270, 600529, 253260, 246450, 210200, 238331). When present in sufficiently high levels, 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid are associated with at least a dozen inborn errors of metabolism, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type I, biotinidase deficiency and isovaleric aciduria, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 1 deficiency, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, late-onset multiple carboxylase deficiency, holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency, and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 2 deficiency. 3-Hydroxyisovaleric acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development.

Acylcarnitines are the product of the conjugation of carnitine with acyl-coenzyme A, that allows the transport of fatty acids across mitochondrial membranes. Long or medium chain fatty acids are then oxidized in the mitochondria for energy production. The ionic nature of L-carnitine causes high water solubility which decreases with increasing chain lengths of the ester group in the acylcarnitines. Therefore, the distribution of L-carnitine and acylcarnitines in various organs is defined not only by their function but also by their physicochemical properties. Hexanoylcarnitine is a medium-chain acylcarnitine present in the urine of patients with medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (PMID: 1635814). Hexanoylcarnitine is also found to be associated with celiac disease and glutaric aciduria II which are both inborn errors of metabolism. Numerous disorders have been described that lead to disturbances in energy production and in intermediary metabolism, which are characterized by the production and excretion of unusual acylcarnitines. A mutation in the gene coding for carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase or the OCTN2 transporter aetiologically causes a carnitine deficiency that results in poor intestinal absorption of dietary L-carnitine, its impaired reabsorption by the kidney and, consequently, in increased urinary loss of L-carnitine. Determination of the qualitative pattern of acylcarnitines can be of diagnostic and therapeutic importance. The betaine structure of carnitine requires special analytical procedures for recording. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) permits screening for free and total carnitine, as well as complete quantitative acylcarnitine determination, including the long-chain acylcarnitine profile (PMID: 17508264, Monatshefte fuer Chemie (2005), 136(8), 1279-1291., Int J Mass Spectrom. 1999;188:39-52.).",HMDB0000756_nmroned_1525_30779.txt,nmroned,"hexanoylcarnitine (r)-caproylcarnitine (r)-hexanoylcarnitine hexanoyl-l-carnitine l-hexanoylcarnitine o-hexanoyl-(r)-carnitine (r)-3-carboxy-n,n,n-trimethyl-2-[(1-oxohexyl)oxy]-1-propanaminium inner salt hexanoate hexanoic acid hexanoic acid ester with l-(3-carboxy-2-hydroxypropyl)trimethylammonium hydroxide inner salt l-carnitine hexanoyl ester l-hexanoate l-hexanoic acid l-hexanoic acid ester with (3-carboxy-2-hydroxypropyl)trimethylammonium hydroxide inner salt c6 carnitine hexanoylcarnitine"

The simplest structure of glycogen is made up of four units of glucose with an approximate molecular weight of 666 daltons. However, large molecules of glycogen can reach molecular weights in the order of 5 million Da. Most of the glucose units are linked together by alpha-1,4 glycosidic bonds, and approximately 1 in 12 glucose residues also form a 1,6 glycosidic bond with a second glucose, resulting in the creation of a branch. Glycogen only has one reducing end and a large number of non-reducing ends with a free hydroxyl group at carbon 4. The glycogen granules contain both glycogen and the enzymes of glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis) and degradation (glycogenolysis). The enzymes are nested between the outer branches of the glycogen molecules and act on the non-reducing ends. Therefore, the many non-reducing end-branches of glycogen facilitate its rapid synthesis and breakdown. In hypoglycemia caused by excessive insulin, liver glycogen levels are high, but the high insulin level prevents the necessary glycogenolysis to take place to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Glucagon is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia. Glycogen is a polysaccharide that is the principal storage form of glucose (Glc) in animal cells. Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the cytosol in many cell types. Hepatocytes (liver cells) have the highest concentration of it - up to 8% of the fresh weight in well fed state, or 100 to 120 g in an adult - giving liver a distinctive, 'starchy taste'. In the muscles, glycogen is found in a much lower concentration (1% of the muscle mass), but the total amount exceeds that in liver.

It is formed from chenodeoxycholate by bacterial action and is usually conjugated with glycine or taurine. It acts as a detergent to solubilize fats for absorption and is itself absorbed. It is used as cholagogue and choleretic. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in the bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute and depends only on the presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine, and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH, and consequently require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g. membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues (PMID: 11316487, 16037564, 12576301, 11907135). When present in sufficiently high levels, lithocholic acid can act as an oncometabolite. An oncometabolite is a compound that when present at chronically high levels promotes tumour growth and survival. Chronically high levels of lithocholic acid are associated with several forms of cancer including colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer, and many other GI cancers. High bile acid levels lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, disruption of the cell membrane and mitochondria, induction of DNA damage, mutation and apoptosis, and the development of reduced apoptosis capability upon chronic exposure (PMID: 24884764).

The structure of mannitol is made of a straight chain of six carbon atoms, each of which is substituted with a hydroxyl group. Mannitol is one of the most abundant energy and carbon storage molecules in nature, it is produced by a wide range of organisms such as bacteria, fungi and plants (PMID: 19578847). In medicine, mannitol is used as a diuretic and renal diagnostic aid. Mannitol has little significant energy value as it is largely eliminated from the body before any metabolism can take place. It can be used to treat oliguria associated with kidney failure or other manifestations of inadequate renal function and has been used for determination of glomerular filtration rate. Mannitol is also commonly used as a research tool in cell biological studies, usually to control osmolarity. Mannitol has a tendency to lose a hydrogen ion in aqueous solutions, which causes the solution to become acidic. For this, it is not uncommon to add a weak base, such as sodium bicarbonate, to the solution to adjust its pH. Mannitol is a non-permeating molecule i.e., it cannot cross biological membranes. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic agent and a weak renal vasodilator. Mannitol is found to be associated with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency and ribose-5-phosphate isomerase deficiency, which are inborn errors of metabolism.

N-acyl-alpha amino acids are compounds containing an alpha amino acid which bears an acyl group at its terminal nitrogen atom. N-Acetyl-L-alanine can also be classified as an alpha amino acid or a derivatized alpha amino acid. Technically, N-alpha-Acetyl-L-alanine is a biologically available N-terminal capped form of the proteinogenic alpha amino acid L-alanine.  N-acetyl amino acids can be produced either via direct synthesis of specific N-acetyltransferases or via the proteolytic degradation of N-acetylated proteins by specific hydrolases. N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a widespread and highly conserved process in eukaryotes that is involved in protection and stability of proteins (PMID: 16465618).  About 85% of all human proteins and 68% of all yeast proteins are acetylated at their N-terminus (PMID: 21750686). Several proteins from prokaryotes and archaea are also modified by N-terminal acetylation. The majority of eukaryotic N-terminal-acetylation reactions occur through N-acetyltransferase enzymes or NAT‚Äôs (PMID: 30054468).  These enzymes consist of three main oligomeric complexes NatA, NatB, and NatC, which are composed of at least a unique catalytic subunit and one unique ribosomal anchor. The substrate specificities of different NAT enzymes are mainly determined by the identities of the first two N-terminal residues of the target protein. The human NatA complex co-translationally acetylates N-termini that bear a small amino acid (A, S, T, C, and occasionally V and G) (PMID: 30054468). NatA also exists in a monomeric state and can post-translationally acetylate acidic N-termini residues (D-, E-). NatB and NatC acetylate N-terminal methionine with further specificity determined by the identity of the second amino acid. N-Acetyl-L-alanine is a product of the enzyme known as ribosomal alanine N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.128) which catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group of acetyl CoA to proteins bearing an N-terminal alanine. N-acetylated amino acids, such as N-acetylalanine can be released by an N-acylpeptide hydrolase from peptides generated by proteolytic degradation (PMID: 16465618). Excessive amounts N-acetyl amino acids can be detected in the urine with individuals with aminoacylase I deficiency, a genetic disorder (PMID: 16465618). These include N-acetylalanine (as well as N-acetylserine, N-acetylglutamine, N-acetylglutamate, N-acetylglycine, N-acetylmethionine and smaller amounts of N-acetylthreonine, N-acetylleucine, N-acetylvaline and N-acetylisoleucine. Aminoacylase I is a soluble homodimeric zinc binding enzyme that catalyzes the formation of free aliphatic amino acids from N-acetylated precursors. In humans, Aminoacylase I is encoded by the aminoacylase 1 gene (ACY1) on chromosome 3p21 that consists of 15 exons (OMIM 609924). Individuals with aminoacylase I deficiency will experience convulsions, hearing loss and difficulty feeding (PMID: 16465618). ACY1 can also catalyze the reverse reaction, the synthesis of acetylated amino acids. Many N-acetylamino acids, including N-acetylalanine, are classified as uremic toxins (PMID: 26317986; PMID: 20613759). Uremic toxins are a diverse group of endogenously produced molecules that, if not properly cleared or eliminated by the kidneys, can cause kidney damage, cardiovascular disease and neurological deficits (PMID: 18287557).

Levels of several phenylalanine metabolites, including phenylacetate (PAA), phenyllactate (PLA), and phenylpyruvate (PPA)) are elevated in Phenylketonuria (PKU) (OMIM 261600). Phenyllactic acid is likely produced from phenylpyruvate via the action of lactate dehydrogenase. The D-form of this organic acid is typically derived from bacterial sources while the L-form is almost certainly endogenous. Levels of phenyllactate are normally very low in blood or urine. High levels of PLA in the urine or blood are often indicative of phenylketonuria (PKU) and hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). PKU is due to lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), so that phenylalanine is converted not to tyrosine but to phenylpyruvic acid (a precursor of phenylactate). In particular, excessive phenylalanine is typically metabolized into phenylketones through, a transaminase pathway route involving glutamate. Metabolites of this transamination reaction include phenylacetate, phenylpyruvate and phenethylamine. In persons with PKU, dietary phenylalanine either accumulates in the body or some of it is converted to phenylpyruvic acid and then to phenyllactate through the action of lactate dehydrogenase. Individuals with PKU tend to excrete large quantities of phenylpyruvate, phenylacetate and phenyllactate, along with phenylalanine, in their urine. If untreated, mental retardation effects and microcephaly are evident by the first year along with other symptoms which include: unusual irritability, epileptic seizures and skin lesions. Hyperactivity, EEG abnormalities and seizures, and severe learning disabilities are major clinical problems later in life. A ""musty or mousy"" odor of skin, hair, sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate accumulation); and a tendency to hypopigmentation and eczema are also observed. The neural-development effects of PKU are primarily due to the disruption of neurotransmitter synthesis. In particular, phenylalanine is a large, neutral amino acid which moves across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via the large neutral amino acid transporter (LNAAT). Excessive phenylalanine in the blood saturates the transporter. Thus, excessive levels of phenylalanine significantly decrease the levels of other LNAAs in the brain. But since these amino acids are required for protein and neurotransmitter synthesis, phenylalanine accumulation disrupts brain development, leading to mental retardation.

Within eukaryotic cells, myristic acid is also commonly conjugated to a penultimate N-terminal glycine residue in receptor-associated kinases to confer membrane localization of these enzymes (a post-translational modification called myristoylation via the enzyme N-myristoyltransferase). Myristic acid has a high enough hydrophobicity to allow the myristoylated protein to become incorporated into the fatty acyl core of the phospholipid bilayer of the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells.

N-acyl-alpha amino acids are compounds containing an alpha amino acid which bears an acyl group at its terminal nitrogen atom. N-alpha-Acetyl-L-aspartic acid can also be classified as an alpha amino acid or a derivatized alpha amino acid. Technically, N-Acetyl-L-aspartic acid is a biologically available N-terminal capped form of the proteinogenic alpha amino acid L-aspartic acid. N-acetyl amino acids can be produced either via direct synthesis of specific N-acetyltransferases or via the proteolytic degradation of N-acetylated proteins by specific hydrolases. N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a widespread and highly conserved process in eukaryotes that is involved in protection and stability of proteins (PMID: 16465618).  About 85% of all human proteins and 68% of all yeast proteins are acetylated at their N-terminus (PMID: 21750686). Several proteins from prokaryotes and archaea are also modified by N-terminal acetylation. The majority of eukaryotic N-terminal-acetylation reactions occur through N-acetyltransferase enzymes or NAT‚Äôs (PMID: 30054468).  These enzymes consist of three main oligomeric complexes NatA, NatB, and NatC, which are composed of at least a unique catalytic subunit and one unique ribosomal anchor. The substrate specificities of different NAT enzymes are mainly determined by the identities of the first two N-terminal residues of the target protein. The human NatA complex co-translationally acetylates N-termini that bear a small amino acid (A, S, T, C, and occasionally V and G) (PMID: 30054468). NatA also exists in a monomeric state and can post-translationally acetylate acidic N-termini residues (D-, E-). NatB and NatC acetylate N-terminal methionine with further specificity determined by the identity of the second amino acid.  N-acetylated amino acids, such as N-acetylaspartate can be released by an N-acylpeptide hydrolase from peptides generated by proteolytic degradation (PMID: 16465618). In addition to the NAT enzymes and protein-based acetylation, N-acetylation of free aspartic acid can also occur. In particular, N-Acetyl-L-aspartic acid can be synthesized in neurons from the amino acid aspartate and acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA). Specifically, the enzyme known as aspartate N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.17) catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group of acetyl CoA to the amino group of aspartate. N-Acetyl-L-aspartic acid is the second most concentrated molecule in the brain after the amino acid glutamate. The various functions served by N-acetylaspartic acid are still under investigation, but the primary proposed functions include (1) acting as a neuronal osmolyte that is involved in fluid balance in the brain, (2) serving as a source of acetate for lipid and myelin synthesis in oligodendrocytes (the glial cells that myelinate neuronal axons), (3) serving as a precursor for the synthesis of the important dipeptide neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), and (4) playing a potential role in energy production from the amino acid glutamate in neuronal mitochondria. High neurotransmitter (i.e. N-acetylaspartic acid) levels can lead to abnormal neural signaling, delayed or arrested intellectual development, and difficulties with general motor skills. When present in sufficiently high levels, N-acetylaspartic acid can be a neurotoxin, an acidogen, and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that disrupts or attacks neural tissue. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of N-acetylaspartic acid are associated with Canavan disease. Because N-acetylaspartic acid functions as an organic acid and high levels of organic acids can lead to a condition known as acidosis. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. Infants with acidosis have symptoms that include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and flapping tremors.  Many N-acetylamino acids, including N-acetylaspartic acid, are classified as uremic toxins if present in high abundance in the serum or plasma (PMID: 26317986; PMID: 20613759). Uremic toxins are a diverse group of endogenously produced molecules that, if not properly cleared or eliminated by the kidneys, can cause kidney damage, cardiovascular disease and neurological deficits (PMID: 18287557).",HMDB0000812_nmroned_1553_30906.txt,nmroned,"n-acetyl-l-aspartic acid (s)-2-(acetylamino)butanedioic acid (s)-2-(acetylamino)succinic acid acetyl-l-aspartic acid acetylaspartic acid l-n-acetylaspartic acid n-acetylaspartic acid naa (s)-2-(acetylamino)butanedioate (s)-2-(acetylamino)succinate acetyl-l-aspartate acetylaspartate l-n-acetylaspartate n-acetylaspartate n-acetyl-l-aspartate (2s)-2-acetamidobutanedioate (2s)-2-acetamidobutanedioic acid n-acetyl-s-aspartate n-acetyl-s-aspartic acid n-acetyl aspartate n-acetylaspartate, monopotassium salt acetyl aspartic acid"

Most uremic toxins are metabolic waste products and are normally excreted in the urine or feces.  Uremic toxins can cause kidney, liver and heart damage. They can also cause changes in mental status, such as confusion, reduced awareness, agitation, psychosis, seizures, and coma. Uremic toxins such as neopterin are actively transported into the kidneys via organic ion transporters (especially OAT3). Elevated levels of neopterin result from immune system activation, including from malignant cancer, allograft rejection, viral infection, and autoimmune disorders (PMID: 19500901).  Measurement of neopterin concentration allows estimation of the extent of oxidative stress elicited by the immune system.

Additionally, the quantity of beta-sitosterol-beta-D-glucoside is often reported. Although the exact mechanism of action of beta-sitosterols is unknown, it may be related to cholesterol metabolism or anti-inflammatory effects (via interference with prostaglandin metabolism).

Derivatives of pimelic acid are involved in the biosynthesis of the amino acid called lysine. Pimelic acid is one methylene longer than a related dicarboxylic acid, adipic acid, a precursor to many polyesters and polyamides. Pimelic acid is essential for the synthesis of biotin (also called vitamin B7). Biotin is a heterocyclic, S-containing monocarboxylic acid that is made from two precursors, alanine and pimeloyl-CoA. Biotin is important in fatty acid synthesis, branched-chain amino acid catabolism, and gluconeogenesis. Biotin is found in a wide range of foods. Likewise, intestinal bacteria synthesize biotin, which is then absorbed by the host animal. Pimelic acid (which is the precursor for pimeloyl-CoA) is synthesized in many bacteria via a head-to-tail incorporation of acetate units through a modified fatty acid synthetic pathway using O-methyl esters disguised to resemble the canonical intermediates of the fatty acid synthetic pathway (PMID:21435937).

N-acyl-alpha amino acids are compounds containing an alpha amino acid which bears an acyl group at its terminal nitrogen atom. N-Acetyltyrosine can also be classified as an alpha amino acid or a derivatized alpha amino acid. Technically, N-Acetyltyrosine is a biologically available N-terminal capped form of the proteinogenic alpha amino acid L-tyrosine. N-acetyl amino acids can be produced either via direct synthesis of specific N-acetyltransferases or via the proteolytic degradation of N-acetylated proteins by specific hydrolases. N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a widespread and highly conserved process in eukaryotes that is involved in protection and stability of proteins (PMID: 16465618).  About 85% of all human proteins and 68% of all yeast proteins are acetylated at their N-terminus (PMID: 21750686). Several proteins from prokaryotes and archaea are also modified by N-terminal acetylation. The majority of eukaryotic N-terminal-acetylation reactions occur through N-acetyltransferase enzymes or NAT‚Äôs (PMID: 30054468).  These enzymes consist of three main oligomeric complexes NatA, NatB, and NatC, which are composed of at least a unique catalytic subunit and one unique ribosomal anchor. The substrate specificities of different NAT enzymes are mainly determined by the identities of the first two N-terminal residues of the target protein. The human NatA complex co-translationally acetylates N-termini that bear a small amino acid (A, S, T, C, and occasionally V and G) (PMID: 30054468). NatA also exists in a monomeric state and can post-translationally acetylate acidic N-termini residues (D-, E-). NatB and NatC acetylate N-terminal methionine with further specificity determined by the identity of the second amino acid.  N-acetylated amino acids, such as N-acetyltyrosine can be released by an N-acylpeptide hydrolase from peptides generated by proteolytic degradation (PMID: 16465618). In addition to the NAT enzymes and protein-based acetylation, N-acetylation of free tyrosine can also occur. Many N-acetylamino acids, including N-acetyltyrosine are classified as uremic toxins if present in high abundance in the serum or plasma (PMID: 26317986; PMID: 20613759). Uremic toxins are a diverse group of endogenously produced molecules that, if not properly cleared or eliminated by the kidneys, can cause kidney damage, cardiovascular disease and neurological deficits (PMID: 18287557). N-Acetyl-L-tyrosine, has also been associated with several inborn metabolic disorders including tyrosinemia I and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency. N-acetyltyrosine, is used in place of as a tyrosine precursor and administered as a source of nutritional support where oral nutrition is inadequate or cannot be tolerated (PMID: 14621123). N-acetyltyrosine has also been identified as an endogenous stress response factor. Under stress conditions, mitochondria release low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggers a cytoprotective response, called ""mitohormesis"". N-acetyltyrosine has recently been identified as an intrinsic triggering factor of mitohormesis in stressed animals (PMID: 32118349). Interventions and small molecules, which promote formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), have been shown to increase stress resistance and lifespan of different model organisms. These phenotypes occur only in response to low concentrations of ROS, while higher concentrations of ROS exert opposing effects. In this regard, a stress-dependent increase in N-acetyltyrosine was recently found to occur in insect larvae that had endured high temperatures (i.e. thermal stress). N-acetyltyrosine treatment has also been demonstrated to induce thermotolerance in several tested insect species. N-acetyltyrosine has been identified in the serum of humans as well as mice, and its concentration in mice was shown to be increased by heat stress, with N-acetyltyrosine pretreatment lowering the concentrations of corticosterone and peroxidized lipids in heat stressed mice (PMID: 33617888).",HMDB0000866_nmroned_1574_31023.txt,nmroned,"n-acetyl-l-tyrosine n-acetyl-4-hydroxyphenylalanine n-acetyltyrosine (2s)-2-acetylamino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoate (2s)-2-acetylamino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid l-n-acetyl-tyrosine l-n-acetyltyrosine n-acetyl-tyrosine n-acetyltyrosine, (dl)-isomer acetyl-l-tyrosine n-acetyltyrosine, (d)-isomer"

Vitamin D3 is a steroid hormone that has long been known for its important role in regulating body levels of calcium and phosphorus, in mineralization of bone, and for the assimilation of Vitamin A. It is structurally similar to steroids such as testosterone, cholesterol, and cortisol (although vitamin D3, itself, is a secosteroid). Vitamin D3 is a derivative of 7-dehydroxycholesterol formed by ultraviolet rays breaking the C9-C10 bond. It differs from ergocalciferol in having a single bond between C22 and C23 and lacking a methyl group at C24. Vitamin D3 can also come from dietary sources, such as beef liver, cheese, egg yolks, and fatty fish (PubChem). The first step involved in the activation of vitamin D3 is a 25-hydroxylation catalyzed by 25-hydroxylase in the liver and then by other enzymes. The mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase catalyzes the first reaction in the oxidation of the side chain of sterol intermediates. The active form of vitamin D3 (calcitriol) binds to intracellular receptors that then function as transcription factors to modulate gene expression. Like the receptors for other steroid hormones and thyroid hormones, the vitamin D receptor has hormone-binding and DNA-binding domains. The vitamin D receptor forms a complex with another intracellular receptor, the retinoid-X receptor, and that heterodimer is what binds to DNA. In most cases studied, the effect is to activate transcription, but situations are also known in which vitamin D suppresses transcription. Calcitriol increases the serum calcium concentrations by (1) increasing GI absorption of phosphorus and calcium, (2) increasing osteoclastic resorption, and (3) increasing distal renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. Calcitriol appears to promote intestinal absorption of calcium through binding to the vitamin D receptor in the mucosal cytoplasm of the intestine. Subsequently, calcium is absorbed through the formation of a calcium-binding protein.",HMDB0000876_nmroned_5203_2733831.txt,nmroned,"vitamin d3 (+)-vitamin d3 (1s,3z)-3-[(2e)-2-[(1r,3ar,7as)-7a-methyl-1-[(2r)-6-methylheptan-2-yl]-2,3,3a,5,6,7-hexahydro-1h-inden-4-ylidene]ethylidene]-4-methylidene-cyclohexan-1-ol (3beta,5z,7e)-9,10-secocholesta-5,7,10(19)-trien-3-ol (5z,7e)-(3s)-9,10-secocholesta-5,7,10(19)-trien-3-ol activated 7-dehydrocholesterol cc cholecalciferol colecalciferol delta-d oleovitamin d3 calciol (3b,5z,7e)-9,10-secocholesta-5,7,10(19)-trien-3-ol (3β,5z,7e)-9,10-secocholesta-5,7,10(19)-trien-3-ol δ-d 7-dehydrocholesterol activated vitamin d dihydrocholesterol vitamin d 3 (3 beta,5z,7e)-9,10-secocholesta-5,7,10(19)-trien-3-ol cholecalciferols vitamin d3"

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. L-valine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Valine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals. It is classified as a non-polar, uncharged (at physiological pH) aliphatic amino acid. Valine was first isolated from casein in 1901 by Hermann Emil Fischer. The name valine comes from valeric acid, which in turn is named after the plant valerian due to the presence of valine in the roots of the plant. Valine is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and it must be obtained from the diet. Human dietary sources are foods that contain protein, such as meats, dairy products, soy products, beans and legumes. L-valine is a branched chain amino acid (BCAA).  The BCAAs consist of leucine, valine and isoleucine (and occasionally threonine). BCAAs are essential amino acids whose carbon structure is marked by a branch point at the beta-carbon position. BCAAs are critical to human life and are particularly involved in stress, energy and muscle metabolism. BCAA supplementation as therapy, both oral and intravenous, in human health and disease holds great promise. BCAAs have different metabolic routes, with valine going solely to carbohydrates (glucogenic), leucine solely to fats (ketogenic) and isoleucine being both a glucogenic and a ketogenic amino acid. The different metabolism accounts for different requirements for these essential amino acids in humans: 12 mg/kg, 14 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg of valine, leucine and isoleucine respectively. Like other branched-chain amino acids, the catabolism of valine starts with the removal of the amino group by transamination, giving alpha-ketoisovalerate, an alpha-keto acid, which is converted to isobutyryl-CoA through oxidative decarboxylation by the branched-chain Œ±-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. This is further oxidised and rearranged to succinyl-CoA, which can enter the citric acid cycle. Furthermore, these amino acids have different deficiency symptoms. Valine deficiency is marked by neurological defects in the brain, while isoleucine deficiency is marked by muscle tremors. Many types of inborn errors of BCAA metabolism exist, and are marked by various abnormalities. The most common form is the maple syrup urine disease, marked by a characteristic urinary odor. Other abnormalities are associated with a wide range of symptoms, such as mental retardation, ataxia, hypoglycemia, spinal muscle atrophy, rash, vomiting and excessive muscle movement. Most forms of BCAA metabolism errors are corrected by dietary restriction of BCAA and at least one form is correctable by supplementation with 10 mg of biotin daily. BCAA are decreased in patients with liver disease, such as hepatitis, hepatic coma, cirrhosis, extrahepatic biliary atresia or portacaval shunt. Valine in particular, has been established as a useful supplemental therapy to the ailing liver. Valine, like other branched-chain amino acids, is associated with insulin resistance: higher levels of valine are observed in the blood of diabetic mice, rats, and humans (PMID: 25287287). Mice fed a valine deprivation diet for one day have improved insulin sensitivity and feeding of a valine deprivation diet for one week significantly decreases blood glucose levels (PMID: 24684822). In diet-induced obese and insulin resistant mice, a diet with decreased levels of valine and the other branched-chain amino acids results in reduced adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity (PMID: 29266268). In sickle-cell disease, valine substitutes for the hydrophilic amino acid glutamic acid in hemoglobin. Because valine is hydrophobic, the hemoglobin does not fold correctly. Hypervalinemia is another example of an inborn error of metabolism involving valine.

Valeric acid is commonly found in human feces, with an average concentration of 2.4 umol/g feces (range of 0.6-3.8 umol/g) (PMID:6740214). Valeric acid is produced by the gut microbiota, typically Clostridia species and other gut bacterial species such as Megasphaera massiliensis MRx0029 (PMID:30052654) via the condensation of ethanol with propionic acid (PMID:18116989). Valeric acid is largely considered as a gut microbial metabolite. Recently, valeric acid has been found to exert strong gut protective effects. Studies involving mice that received high doses of radiation showed that valeric acid replenishment (via oral gavage) elevated the survival rate of irradiated mice, protected hematogenic organs (such as the thymus and spleen), improved gastrointestinal (GI) tract function and enhanced intestinal epithelial integrity (PMID:31931652 ). Valeric acid was also found to restore the enteric bacteria taxonomic proportions and reprogram the small intestinal protein profile to normal levels. Valeric acid, like butyric acid, also appears to be a potent histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. High levels of HDAC proteins have been implicated in a variety of disease pathologies, from cancer and colitis to cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration (PMID:30052654). Valeric acid is also found in certain plants, specifically in the perennial flowering plant valerian (Valeriana officinalis), from which it gets its name. Industrially valeric acid is primarily used is in the synthesis of its esters. Volatile esters of valeric acid tend to have pleasant odors and are used in perfumes and cosmetics.

Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in the bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depending only on the presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g. membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues (PMID:11316487, 16037564, 12576301, 11907135).

Citrulline exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to humans. Within humans, citrulline participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, citrulline can be biosynthesized from carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine which is catalyzed by the enzyme ornithine carbamoyltransferase. In addition, citrulline and L-aspartic acid can be converted into argininosuccinic acid through the action of the enzyme argininosuccinate synthase. In humans, citrulline is involved in the metabolic disorder called argininemia. Citrulline has also been found to be associated with several diseases such as ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and citrullinemia type II. Citrulline has also been linked to several inborn metabolic disorders including argininosuccinic aciduria and fumarase deficiency. Outside of the human body, citrulline is found, on average, in the highest concentration in a few different foods such as wheats, oats, and cucumbers and in a lower concentration in swiss chards, yellow wax beans, and potato. Citrulline has also been detected, but not quantified in several different foods, such as epazotes, lotus, common buckwheats, strawberry guava, and italian sweet red peppers. Citrulline is a potentially toxic compound.  Proteins that normally contain citrulline residues include myelin basic protein (MBP), filaggrin, and several histone proteins, whereas other proteins, such as fibrin and vimentin are susceptible to citrullination during cell death and tissue inflammation.

Trimethylamine is a nitrogenous base and its positively charged cation is called trimethylammonium cation. A common salt of trimethylamine is trimethylammonium chloride, a hygroscopic colorless solid. Trimethylamine is a product of decomposition of plants and animals. It is the substance mainly responsible for the fishy odor often associated with fouling fish, bacterial vagina infections, and bad breath. It is also associated with taking large doses of choline. Trimethylaminuria is a genetic disorder in which the body is unable to metabolize trimethylamine from food sources. Patients develop a characteristic fish odour of their sweat, urine, and breath after the consumption of choline-rich foods.

In particular, trimethylamine-N-oxide is biosynthesized endogenously from trimethylamine, which is derived from choline, which can be derived from dietary lecithin (phosphatidylcholines) or dietary carnitine. TMAO decomposes to trimethylamine (TMA), which is the main odorant that is characteristic of degrading seafood. TMAO is an osmolyte that the body will use to counteract the effects of increased concentrations of urea (due to kidney failure) and high levels can be used as a biomarker for kidney problems. It has been identified as a uremic toxin according to the European Uremic Toxin Working Group (PMID:22626821). Fish odor syndrome or trimethylaminuria is a defect in the production of the enzyme flavin containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) causing incomplete breakdown of trimethylamine from choline-containing food into trimethylamine oxide. Trimethylamine then builds up and is released in the person's sweat, urine, and breath, giving off a strong fishy odor. The concentration of TMAO in the blood increases after consuming foods containing carnitine or lecithin (phosphatidylcholines), if the bacteria that convert those substances to TMAO are present in the gut (PMID:23614584). High concentrations of carnitine are found in red meat, some energy drinks, and certain dietary supplements; lecithin is found in eggs and is commonly used as an ingredient in processed food. High levels of TMAO are found in many seafoods. Some types of normal gut bacteria (e.g. species of Acinetobacter) in the human gut convert dietary carnitine and dietary lecithin to TMAO (PMID:21475195). TMAO alters cholesterol metabolism in the intestines, in the liver and in arterial wall. When TMAO is present, cholesterol metabolism is altered and there is an increased deposition of cholesterol within, and decreased removal of cholesterol from, peripheral cells such as those in the artery wall (PMID:23563705). Urinary TMAO is a biomarker for the consumption of fish, especially cold-water fish.

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. L-tryptophan is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Tryptophan is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals. It is classified as a non-polar, uncharged (at physiological pH) aromatic amino acid.  Tryptophan is an essential amino acid, meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and it must be obtained from the diet.  The requirement for tryptophan and protein decreases with age. The minimum daily requirement for adults is 3 mg/kg/day or about 200 mg a day. There is 400 mg of tryptophan in a cup of wheat germ. A cup of low-fat cottage cheese contains 300 mg of tryptophan and chicken and turkey contain up to 600 mg of tryptophan per pound (http://www.dcnutrition.com). Tryptophan is particularly plentiful in chocolate, oats, dried dates, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, red meat, eggs, fish, poultry, sesame, chickpeas, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, buckwheat, spirulina, and peanuts. Tryptophan is the precursor of both serotonin and melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone that is produced by the pineal gland in animals, which regulates sleep and wakefulness. Serotonin is a brain neurotransmitter, platelet clotting factor, and neurohormone found in organs throughout the body. Metabolism of tryptophan into serotonin requires nutrients such as vitamin B6, niacin, and glutathione. Niacin (also known as vitamin B3) is an important metabolite of tryptophan. It is synthesized via kynurenine and quinolinic acids, which are products of tryptophan degradation. There are a number of conditions or diseases that are characterized by tryptophan deficiencies. For instance, fructose malabsorption causes improper absorption of tryptophan in the intestine, which reduces levels of tryptophan in the blood and leads to depression. High corn diets or other tryptophan-deficient diets can cause pellagra, which is a niacin-tryptophan deficiency disease with symptoms of dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. Hartnup's disease is a disorder in which tryptophan and other amino acids are not absorbed properly. Symptoms of Hartnup's disease include skin rashes, difficulty coordinating movements (cerebellar ataxia), and psychiatric symptoms such as depression or psychosis. Tryptophan supplements may be useful for treating Hartnup's disease. Assessment of tryptophan deficiency is done through studying excretion of tryptophan metabolites in the urine or blood. Blood may be the most sensitive test because the amino acid tryptophan is transported in a unique way. Increased urination of tryptophan breakdown products (such as kynurenine) correlates with increased tryptophan degradation, which occurs with oral contraception, depression, mental retardation, hypertension, and anxiety states. Tryptophan plays a role in ""feast-induced"" drowsiness. Ingestion of a meal rich in carbohydrates triggers the release of insulin. Insulin, in turn, stimulates the uptake of large neutral branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) into muscle, increasing the ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the bloodstream. The increased tryptophan ratio reduces competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter (which transports both BCAAs and tryptophan), resulting in greater uptake of tryptophan across the blood-brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Once in the CSF, tryptophan is converted into serotonin and the resulting serotonin is further metabolized into melatonin by the pineal gland, which promotes sleep. Because tryptophan is converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) which is then converted into the neurotransmitter serotonin, it has been proposed that consumption of tryptophan or 5-HTP may improve depression symptoms by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain. Tryptophan is sold over the counter in the United States (after being banned to varying extents between 1989 and 2005) and the United Kingdom as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, anxiolytic, and sleep aid. It is also marketed as a prescription drug in some European countries for the treatment of major depression. There is evidence that blood tryptophan levels are unlikely to be altered by changing the diet, but consuming purified tryptophan increases the serotonin level in the brain, whereas eating foods containing tryptophan does not. This is because the transport system that brings tryptophan across the blood‚Äìbrain barrier also transports other amino acids which are contained in protein food sources. Under certain situations, tryptophan can be a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that causes damage to the brain and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of tryptophan can be found in glutaric aciduria type I (glutaric acidemia type I or GA1). GA1 is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to completely break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan due to a deficiency of mitochondrial glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.7, GCDH). Excessive levels of their intermediate breakdown products (e.g. glutaric acid, glutaryl-CoA, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaconic acid) can accumulate and cause damage to the brain (and also other organs), but particularly the basal ganglia. Babies with glutaric acidemia type I are often born with unusually large heads (macrocephaly). Other symptoms include spasticity (increased muscle tone/stiffness) and dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions resulting in abnormal movement or posture), but many affected individuals are asymptomatic. High levels of tryptophan have also been implicated in eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS), an incurable and sometimes fatal flu-like neurological condition linked to the ingestion of large amounts of L-tryptophan. The risk of developing EMS increases with larger doses of tryptophan and increasing age. Some research suggests that certain genetic polymorphisms may be related to the development of EMS. The presence of eosinophilia is a core feature of EMS, along with unusually severe myalgia (muscle pain). It is thought that both tryptophan and certain unidentified tryptophan contaminants may contribute to EMS (PMID: 1763543 ). It has also been suggested that excessive tryptophan or elevation of its metabolites could play a role in amplifying some of the pathological features of EMS (PMID: 10721094 ). This pathological damage is further augmented by metabolites of the kynurenine pathway (a tryptophan degradation pathway).",HMDB0000929_nmroned_1608_31286.txt,nmroned,l-tryptophan (2s)-2-amino-3-(1h-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (s)-alpha-amino-1h-indole-3-propanoic acid (s)-alpha-amino-beta-(3-indolyl)-propionic acid (s)-tryptophan l-(-)-tryptophan l-beta-3-indolylalanine trp tryptophan w (2s)-2-amino-3-(1h-indol-3-yl)propanoate (s)-a-amino-1h-indole-3-propanoate (s)-a-amino-1h-indole-3-propanoic acid (s)-alpha-amino-1h-indole-3-propanoate (s)-α-amino-1h-indole-3-propanoate (s)-α-amino-1h-indole-3-propanoic acid (s)-a-amino-b-(3-indolyl)-propionate (s)-a-amino-b-(3-indolyl)-propionic acid (s)-alpha-amino-beta-(3-indolyl)-propionate (s)-α-amino-β-(3-indolyl)-propionate (s)-α-amino-β-(3-indolyl)-propionic acid l-b-3-indolylalanine l-β-3-indolylalanine (-)-tryptophan (l)-tryptophan (s)-1h-indole-3-alanine (s)-2-amino-3-(3-indolyl)propionic acid (s)-a-amino-b-indolepropionate (s)-a-amino-b-indolepropionic acid (s)-a-aminoindole-3-propionate (s)-a-aminoindole-3-propionic acid (s)-alpha-amino-beta-indolepropionate (s)-alpha-amino-beta-indolepropionic acid (s)-alpha-aminoindole-3-propionate (s)-alpha-aminoindole-3-propionic acid 1-beta-3-indolylalanine 1beta-3-indolylalanine 1h-indole-3-alanine 2-amino-3-indolylpropanoate 2-amino-3-indolylpropanoic acid 3-(1h-indol-3-yl)-l-alanine 3-indol-3-ylalanine alpha'-amino-3-indolepropionic acid alpha-aminoindole-3-propionic acid ardeytropin h-trp-oh indole-3-alanine kalma l-alpha-amino-3-indolepropionic acid l-alpha-aminoindole-3-propionic acid l-tryptofan l-tryptophane lopac-t-0254 lyphan optimax pacitron sedanoct triptofano trofan tryptacin tryptan tryptophane tryptophanum ardeydorm l tryptophan l-tryptophan-ratiopharm merck brand of tryptophan niddapharm brand of tryptophan icn brand of tryptophan levotryptophan pms tryptophan pms-tryptophan ratiopharm brand of tryptophan esparma brand of tryptophan ratio-tryptophan l tryptophan ratiopharm naturruhe tryptophan metabolism alterations ardeypharm brand of tryptophan kalma brand of tryptophan pharmascience brand of tryptophan upsher-smith brand of tryptophan ratio tryptophan

One such phytosterol complex, isolated from vegetable oil, is cholestatin, composed of campesterol, stigmasterol, and brassicasterol, and is marketed as a dietary supplement. Sterols can reduce cholesterol in human subjects by up to 15%. The mechanism behind phytosterols and the lowering of cholesterol occurs as follows : the incorporation of cholesterol into micelles in the gastrointestinal tract is inhibited, decreasing the overall amount of cholesterol absorbed. This may in turn help to control body total cholesterol levels, as well as modify HDL, LDL and TAG levels. Many margarines, butters, breakfast cereals and spreads are now enriched with phytosterols and marketed towards people with high cholesterol and a wish to lower it.

S-Adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy or SAH) is also the immediate precursor of all of the homocysteine produced in the body. The reaction is catalyzed by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and is reversible with the equilibrium favoring formation of SAH. In vivo, the reaction is driven in the direction of homocysteine formation by the action of the enzyme adenosine deaminase which converts the second product of the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase reaction, adenosine, to inosine. Except for methyl transfer from betaine and from methylcobalamin in the methionine synthase reaction, SAH is the product of all methylation reactions that involve S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methyl donor. Methylation is significant in epigenetic regulation of protein expression via DNA and histone methylation. The inhibition of these SAM-mediated processes by SAH is a proven mechanism for metabolic alteration. Because the conversion of SAH to homocysteine is reversible, with the equilibrium favoring the formation of SAH, increases in plasma homocysteine are accompanied by an elevation of SAH in most cases. Disturbances in the transmethylation pathway indicated by abnormal SAH, SAM, or their ratio have been reported in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia, depression, and Parkinson's disease (PMID:18065573, 17892439). Therefore, when present in sufficiently high levels, S-adenosylhomocysteine can act as an immunotoxin and a metabotoxin. An immunotoxin disrupts, limits the function, or destroys immune cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenous metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of S-adenosylhomocysteine are associated with S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase deficiency and adenosine deaminase deficiency. S-Adenosylhomocysteine forms when there are elevated levels of homocysteine and adenosine. S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine is a potent inhibitor of S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methylation reactions.

It is one of the most abundant phenolic acids in plants, varying from 5 g/kg in wheat bran to 9 g/kg in sugar-beet pulp and 50 g/kg in corn kernel. It occurs primarily in seeds and leaves both in its free form (albeit rarely) and covalently linked to lignin and other biopolymers. It is usually found as ester cross-links with polysaccharides in the cell wall, such as arabinoxylans in grasses, pectin in spinach and sugar beet, and xyloglucans in bamboo. It also can cross-link with proteins. Due to its phenolic nucleus and an extended side chain conjugation (carbohydrates and proteins), it readily forms a resonance-stabilized phenoxy radical which accounts for its potent antioxidant potential.

It occurs naturally in many plants, particularly grapes and tamarinds, and is one of the main acids found in wine. It is added to other foods to give a sour taste, and is used as an antioxidant. Salts of tartaric acid are known as tartrates. It is a dihydroxy derivative of dicarboxylic acid. Tartaric acid is a muscle toxin, which works by inhibiting the production of malic acid, and in high doses causes paralysis and death. The minimum recorded fatal dose for a human is about 12 grams. In spite of that, it is included in many foods, especially sour-tasting sweets. As a food additive, tartaric acid is used as an antioxidant with E number E334, tartrates are other additives serving as antioxidants or emulsifiers. Naturally-occurring tartaric acid is chiral, meaning that it has molecules that are non-superimposable on their mirror-images. It is a useful raw material in organic chemistry for the synthesis of other chiral molecules. The naturally occurring form of the acid is L-(+)-tartaric acid or dextrotartaric acid. The mirror-image (enantiomeric) form, levotartaric acid or D-(-)-tartaric acid, and the achiral form, mesotartaric acid, can be made artificially. Tartarate is believed to play a role in inhibiting kidney stone formation. Most tartarate that is consumed by humans is metabolized by bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract -- primarily in the large instestine. Only about 15-20% of consumed tartaric acid is secreted in the urine unchanged. Tartaric acid is a biomarker for the consumption of wine and grapes (PMID:24507823). Tartaric acid is also a fungal metabolite, elevated levels in the urine (especially in children) may be due to the presence of yeast (in the gut or bladder). It can be produced by Agrobacterium, Nocardia, Rhizobium, Saccharomyces as well (PMID:7628083) (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1005592104426).

It was first prepared in 1839 by H. Reinsch by distilling catechin (the juice of Mimosa catechu). This colourless compound occurs naturally, but about 20000 tons are manufactured each year, mainly as precursors to pesticides, flavors, and fragrances. Its sulfonic acid is often present in the urine of many mammals. Small amounts of catechol occur naturally in fruits and vegetables, along with the enzyme polyphenol oxidase. Upon mixing the enzyme with the substrate and exposure to oxygen (as when a potato or apple is cut), the colorless catechol oxidizes to reddish-brown benzoquinone derivatives.

It is thought to be implicated in anhydrobiosis - the ability of plants and animals to withstand prolonged periods of desiccation. The sugar is thought to form a gel phase as cells dehydrate, which prevents disruption of internal cell organelles by effectively splinting them in position. Rehydration then allows normal cellular activity to be resumed without the major, generally lethal damage that would normally follow a dehydration/reyhdration cycle. Trehalose is a non-reducing sugar formed from two glucose units joined by a 1-1 alpha bond giving it the name of alpha-D-glucopyranoglucopyranosyl-1,1-alpha-D-glucopyranoside. The bonding makes trehalose very resistant to acid hydrolysis, and therefore stable in solution at high temperatures even under acidic conditions. The bonding also keeps non-reducing sugars in closed-ring form, such that the aldehyde or ketone end-groups do not bind to the lysine or arginine residues of proteins (a process called glycation). The enzyme trehalase, present but not abundant in most people, breaks it into two glucose molecules, which can then be readily absorbed in the gut. Trehalose is an important components of insects circulating fluid. It acts as a storage form of insect circulating fluid and it is important in respiration.

It is also the predominant human metabolite of nicotine (when nicotine is inhaled or absorbed). In humans, about 70 to 80% of nicotine that is inhaled or absorbed is converted to cotinine. This transformation involves two steps. The first is mediated by a cytochrome P450 system (mainly CYP2A6 and CYP2B6) to produce nicotine iminium ion. The second step is catalyzed by aldehyde oxidase (AOX). A number of cotinine metabolites have also been structurally characterized. Indeed, it appears that most of the reported urinary metabolites of nicotine are derived from cotinine. Cotinine is widely used as a biomarker for exposure to tobacco smoke. Cotinine has an in vivo half-life of approximately 20 hours, and is typically detectable for several days (up to one week) after the use of tobacco.

NAAG is released upon depolarization by a Ca(2+)-dependent process and is an agonist at mGluR3 receptors and an antagonist at NMDA receptors. NAAG is catabolized to N-acetylaspartate and glutamate primarily by glutamate carboxypeptidase II, which is expressed on the extracellular surface of astrocytes. The levels of NAAG and the activity of carboxypeptidase II are altered in a regionally specific fashion in several neuropsychiatric disorders (PMID:9361299). N-Acetylaspartylglutamic acid (NAAG) is a purported precursor of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) and is present at about one-tenth of the concentration of NAA in the brain. NAAG has been reported to activate N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors in neurons. Previous immunohistochemical studies in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) have suggested that NAAG is exclusively localized to neurons. Recent evidence, however, indicates that NAAG might also be localized to nonneuronal cells within the CNS. Only traces of NAA and NAAG are detectable in other tissues. Some compounds can change levels of NAA and NAAG in the brain. For example, methylphenidate increases the levels of NAA and NAAG in the cerebral cortex; amphetamine also increases NAA concentration in a mature brain by 26%, raising the possibility that other neurochemical systems might be involved in the clinical effects of stimulants (PMID:10603234).",HMDB0001067_nmroned_5228_2734168.txt,nmroned,n-acetylaspartylglutamic acid isospaglumic acid n-ac-d-e n-acetyl-1-aspartylglutamic acid n-acetyl-l-asp-l-glu naag isospaglumate n-acetyl-1-aspartylglutamate n-acetylaspartylglutamate n-acetyl-l-alpha-aspartylglutamic acid n-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate n-acetyl-1-asp-glu n-(n-acetyl-l-alpha-aspartyl)-l-glutamic acid naaxia naaga n-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamic acid acetyl-alpha-l-aspartylglutamic acid acetyl-α-l-aspartylglutamic acid n-(n-acetylaspartyl)glutamic acid n-acetyl-l-alpha-aspartyl-l-glutamic acid n-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamic acid n-acetyl-l-α-aspartyl-l-glutamic acid n-acetyl-alpha-l-aspartyl-l-glutamic acid n-acetyl-alpha-aspartylglutamic acid n-acetyl-α-l-aspartyl-l-glutamic acid n-acetyl-α-aspartylglutamic acid alpha-spaglumic acid α-spaglumic acid n-acetylaspartylglutamic acid

Octanol is mainly produced industrially by the oligomerization of ethylene using triethylaluminium followed by oxidation of the alkylaluminium products. This route is known as the Ziegler alcohol synthesis. Octanol also occurs naturally in the form of esters in some essential oils. Octanol and water are immiscible. The distribution of a compound between water and octanol is used to calculate the partition coefficient (logP) of that molecule. Water/octanol partitioning is a good approximation of the partitioning between the cytosol and lipid membranes of living systems. Octanol is a colorless, slightly viscous liquid used as a defoaming or wetting agent. It is also used as a solvent for protective coatings, waxes, and oils, and as a raw material for plasticizers.

It has important effects during labour and also stimulates osteoblasts to release factors which stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts (a type of bone cell that removes bone tissue by removing the bone's mineralized matrix). PGE2 is also the prostaglandin that ultimately induces fever. PGE2 has been shown to increase vasodilation and cAMP production, enhance the effects of bradykinin and histamine, and induce uterine contractions and platelet aggregation. PGE2 is also responsible for maintaining the open passageway of the fetal ductus arteriosus, decreasing T-cell proliferation and lymphocyte migration, and activating the secretion of IL-1α and IL-2. PGE2 exhibits both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects, particularly on dendritic cells (DC). Depending on the nature of maturation signals, PGE2 has different and sometimes opposite effects on DC biology. PGE2 exerts an inhibitory action, reducing the maturation of DC and their ability to present antigen. PGE2 has also been shown to stimulate DC and promote IL-12 production when given in combination with TNF-alpha. PGE2 is an environmentally bioactive substance. Its action is prolonged and sustained by other factors especially IL-10. It modulates the activities of professional DC by acting on their differentiation, maturation, and their ability to secrete cytokines. PGE2 is a potent inducer of IL-10 in bone marrow-derived DC (BM-DC). PGE2-induced IL-10 is a key regulator of the BM-DC pro-inflammatory phenotype (PMID:16978535). Prostaglandins are eicosanoids. The eicosanoids consist of the prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs), and lipoxins (LXs). The PGs and TXs are collectively identified as prostanoids. Prostaglandins were originally shown to be synthesized in the prostate gland, thromboxanes from platelets (thrombocytes), and leukotrienes from leukocytes, hence the derivation of their names. All mammalian cells except erythrocytes synthesize eicosanoids. These molecules are extremely potent and are able to cause profound physiological effects at very dilute concentrations.

It belongs to the class of organic compounds known as nitrophenols. Nitrophenols are compounds containing a nitrophenol moiety, which consists of a benzene ring bearing both a hydroxyl group and a nitro group on two different ring carbon atoms. 4-Nitrophenol shows two polymorphs in the crystalline state. The alpha-form is colorless pillars, unstable at room temperature, and stable toward sunlight. The beta-form is yellow pillars, stable at room temperature, and gradually turns red upon irradiation of sunlight. Usually 4-nitrophenol exists as a mixture of these two forms. 4-Nitrophenol can be used as a pH indicator and as an intermediate in the synthesis of paracetamol. Itis also used as the precursor for the preparation of phenetidine and acetophenetidine, indicators, and raw materials for fungicides. Bioaccumulation of this compound rarely occurs. In peptide synthesis, carboxylate ester derivatives of 4-nitrophenol may serve as activated components for construction of amide moieties. 4-Nitrophenol is a potentially toxic compound: it can cause eyes, skin, and respiratory tract irritations. It may also cause inflammation of those parts. It has a delayed interaction with blood and forms methaemoglobin which is responsible for methemoglobinemia -which is characterized by tissue hypoxia, as methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen-, potentially causing cyanosis, confusion, and unconsciousness. When ingested, it causes abdominal pain and vomiting. Prolonged contact with skin may cause allergic response. Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of 4-nitrophenol are not known. The LD50 in mice is 282 mg/kg and in rats is 202 mg/kg. Outside of the human body, 4-Nitrophenol has been detected, but not quantified in cow milk.

It also has biological activity in its own right, including acting as a melatonin receptor agonist, an agonist of the TrkB, and having antioxidant effects. N-Acetylserotonin is an intermediate in the metabolic pathway of melatonin and indoleamine in the pineal gland of mammalians. Serotonin-N-acetyltransferase (SNAT), which regulates the rate of melatonin biosynthesis in the pineal gland, catalyzes the acetylation of 5HT to N-acetylserotonin (NAS). A methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine is transferred to NAS by hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT), and finally NAS is converted to 5-methoxy-N-acetyltryptamine, or melatonin. In most mammalian species the content of NAS (and melatonin) in the pineal gland shows clear circadian changes with the highest level occurring during the dark period. This elevation of the contents of NAS (and melatonin) in the dark period is due to the increase of SNAT activity and the elevation of SNAT gene expression. Experimental studies show that N-acetylserotonin possess free radical scavenging activity. Acute administration of irreversible and reversible selective MAO-A inhibitors and high doses (or chronic administration of low doses) of relatively selective MAO-B inhibitors (but not of highly selective MAO-B inhibitors) suppressed MAO-A activity and stimulated N-acetylation of pineal serotonin into N-acetylserotonin, the immediate precursor of melatonin. N-acetylserotonin increase after MAO-A inhibitors might mediate their antidepressive and antihypertensive effects. N-Acetylserotonin is the product of the O-demethylation of melatonin mediated by cytochrome P-450 isoforms: Cytochrome p450, subfamily IIc, polypeptide 19 (CYP2C19, a clinically important enzyme that metabolizes a wide variety of drugs), with a minor contribution from Cytochrome p450, subfamily I, polypeptide (2CYP1A2, involved in O-deethylation of phenacetin). (PMID 15616152, 11103901, 10721079, 10591054). N-Acetylserotonin acts as a potent antioxidant, NAS effectiveness as an anti-oxidant has been found to be different depending on the experimental model used, it has been described as being between 5 and 20 times more effect than melatonin at protecting against oxidant damage.

The intermediate is spermidine. Spermine is a drug. Spermine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to humans. 5'-methylthioadenosine and spermine can be biosynthesized from S-adenosylmethioninamine and spermidine through its interaction with the enzyme spermine synthase.

These are organic compounds containing a dialkylamine group, characterized by two alkyl groups bonded to the amino nitrogen. Abnormal bleeding, such as bleeding spontaneously or profusely from a very minor injury can also occur. Spermidine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to humans. Within humans, spermidine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, 5'-methylthioadenosine and spermidine can be biosynthesized from S-adenosylmethioninamine and putrescine by the enzyme spermidine synthase. In addition, S-adenosylmethioninamine and spermidine can be converted into 5'-methylthioadenosine and spermine through the action of the enzyme spermine synthase. In humans, spermidine is involved in spermidine and spermine biosynthesis. Outside of the human body, spermidine is found, on average, in the highest concentration within cow milk and oats. Spermidine has also been detected, but not quantified in several different foods, such as common chokecherries, watercress, agars, strawberry guava, and bog bilberries. This could make spermidine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these foods. Spermidine is consideres as an uremic toxine. Increased levels of uremic toxins can stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species. Chronic exposure to uremic toxins can lead to a number of conditions including renal damage, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. As a uremic toxin, this compound can cause uremic syndrome. Uremic toxins such as spermidine are actively transported into the kidneys via organic ion transporters (especially OAT3).",HMDB0001257_nmroned_1671_31686.txt,nmroned,"spermidine 1,5,10-triazadecane 4-azaoctamethylenediamine 4-azaoctane-1,8-diamine n-(3-aminopropyl)-1,4-butane-diamine spermidin 1,8-diamino-4-azaoctane aminopropylbutandiamine n-(3-aminopropyl)-1,4-butanediamine n-(3-aminopropyl)-1,4-diamino-butane n-(3-aminopropyl)-1,4-diaminobutane n-(3-aminopropyl)-4-aminobutylamine n-(4-aminobutyl)-1,3-diaminopropane n-(gamma-aminopropyl)tetramethylenediamine spd"

It is formed from GABA by the action of GABA transaminase, which leads to the production of succinate semialdehyde and alanine. The resulting succinate semialdehyde is further oxidized by succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase to become succinic acid, which also yields NADPH. Under certain situations, high levels of succinate semialdehyde can function as a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that causes damage to the brain and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Elevated serum levels of succinate semialdehyde are found in succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency (gamma-hydroxybutyric aciduria), a rare neurometabolic disorder of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) degradation. Symptoms include motor delay, hypotonia, speech delay, autistic features, seizures, and ataxia. Patients also exhibit behavioural problems such as attention deficit, hyperactivity, anxiety, or aggression (PMID:18622364). Succinate semialdehyde is considered a reactive carbonyl and may lead to increased oxidative stress. This stress is believed to contribute to the formation of free radicals in the brain tissue of animal models induced with SSADH deficiency, which further leads to secondary cell damage and death.

Dehydroascorbic acid, also known as L-dehydroascorbate or DHAA, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gamma butyrolactones. Gamma butyrolactones are compounds containing a gamma butyrolactone moiety, which consists of an aliphatic five-member ring with four carbon atoms, one oxygen atom, and bears a ketone group on the carbon adjacent to the oxygen atom. Dehydroascorbic acid has similar biological activity as ascorbic acid. Currently dehydroascorbic acid is an experimental drug with no known approved indications. Dehydroascorbic acid may be a unique E. coli metabolite.

In humans, dehydroascorbic acid is involved in the metabolic disorder called tyrosinemia type I. Concerning dehydroascorbic acid's antiviral effect against herpes simplex virus type 1, it is suggested that dehydroascorbic acid acts after replication of viral DNA and prevents the assembly of progeny virus particles. This is important because one study has found that after an ischemic stroke, dehydroascorbic acid has neuroprotective effects by reducing infarct volume, neurological deficits, and mortality. This reaction is reversible, but dehydroascorbic acid can instead undergo irreversible hydrolysis to 2,3-diketogulonic acid. In addition, unlike ascorbic Dehydroascorbic acid acid can cross the blood brain barrier and is then converted to ascorbic acid to enable retention in the brain. Dehydroascorbic acid is made from the oxidation of ascorbic acid. The exact mechanism of action is still being investigated, but some have been elucidated. Both compounds have been shown to have antiviral effects against herpes simplex virus type 1, influenza virus type A and poliovirus type 1 with dehydroascorbic acid having the stronger effect. In the body, both dehydroascorbic acid and ascorbic acid have similar biological activity as antivirals but dehydroascorbic acid also has neuroprotective effects.

Alanine levels parallel blood sugar levels in both diabetes and hypoglycemia, and alanine reduces both severe hypoglycemia and the ketosis of diabetes. It is an important amino acid for lymphocyte reproduction and immunity. Alanine therapy has helped dissolve kidney stones in experimental animals. Normal alanine metabolism, like that of other amino acids, is highly dependent upon enzymes that contain vitamin B6.

DOPAC is a neuronal metabolite of dopamine (DA). DA undergoes monoamine oxidase-catalyzed oxidative deamination to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), which is metabolized primarily into DOPAC via aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2). The biotransformation of DOPAL is critical as previous studies have demonstrated this DA-derived aldehyde to be a reactive electrophile and toxic to dopaminergic cells. Known inhibitors of mitochondrial ALDH2, such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE) inhibit ALDH2-mediated oxidation of the endogenous neurotoxin DOPAL. 4HNE is one of the resulting products of oxidative stress, thus linking oxidative stress to the uncontrolled production of an endogenous neurotoxin relevant to Parkinson's disease. In early-onset Parkinson disease, there is markedly reduced activities of both monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B. The amount of DOPAC, which is produced during dopamine oxidation by MAO, is greatly reduced as a result of increased parkin overexpression. Administration of methamphetamine to animals causes loss of DA terminals in the brain and significant decreases in dopamine and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the striatum. Renal dopamine produced in the residual tubular units may be enhanced during a sodium challenge, thus behaving appropriately as a compensatory natriuretic hormone; however, the renal dopaminergic system in patients afflicted with renal parenchymal disorders should address parameters other than free urinary dopamine, namely the urinary excretion of L-DOPA and metabolites. DOPAC is one of the major phenolic acids formed during human microbial fermentation of tea, citrus, and soy flavonoid supplements. DOPAC exhibits a considerable antiproliferative effect in LNCaP prostate cancer and HCT116 colon cancer cells. The antiproliferative activity of DOPAC may be due to its catechol structure. A similar association of the catechol moiety in the B-ring with antiproliferative activity was demonstrated for flavanones (PMID:16956664, 16455660, 8561959, 11369822, 10443478, 16365058).

It usually consists of phosphorylcholine and ceramide. SM(d18:1/18:0) consists of a sphingosine backbone and a stearic acid chain. In humans, sphingomyelin is the only membrane phospholipid not derived from glycerol. Like all sphingolipids, SM has a ceramide core (sphingosine bonded to a fatty acid via an amide linkage). In addition, it contains one polar head group, which is either phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine. The plasma membrane of cells is highly enriched in sphingomyelin and is considered largely to be found in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. However, there is some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2, an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelin into ceramide, has been found to localize exclusively to the inner leaflet further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there. Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called Niemann-Pick Disease, types A and B. Niemann-Pick disease is a genetically-inherited disease caused by a deficiency in the enzyme sphingomyelinase, which causes the accumulation of sphingomyelin in spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage.

In particular, 3-mercaptopyruvic acid and cyanide can be converted into pyruvic acid and thiocyanate; which is mediated by the enzyme 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. In addition, 3-mercaptopyruvic acid can be biosynthesized from 3-mercaptolactic acid; which is mediated by the enzyme L-lactate dehydrogenase. It has been studied as a potential treatment for cyanide poisoning, but its half-life is too short for it to be clinically effective. In humans, 3-mercaptopyruvic acid is involved in cystinosis, ocular nonnephropathic. Outside of the human body, 3-mercaptopyruvic acid has been detected, but not quantified in several different foods, such as lima beans, spinachs, shallots, mexican groundcherries, and white lupines.

Certain nuts (English walnuts) and vegetable oils (canola, soybean, flaxseed/linseed, olive) are particularly rich in alpha-linolenic acid. Omega-3 fatty acids get their name based on the location of one of their first double bond. In all omega-3 fatty acids, the first double bond is located between the third and fourth carbon atom counting from the methyl end of the fatty acid (n-3). Although humans and other mammals can synthesize saturated and some monounsaturated fatty acids from carbon groups in carbohydrates and proteins, they lack the enzymes necessary to insert a cis double bond at the n-6 or the n-3 position of a fatty acid. Omega-3 fatty acids like alpha-linolenic acid are important structural components of cell membranes. When incorporated into phospholipids, they affect cell membrane properties such as fluidity, flexibility, permeability, and the activity of membrane-bound enzymes. Omega-3 fatty acids can modulate the expression of a number of genes, including those involved with fatty acid metabolism and inflammation. alpha-Linolenic acid and other omega-3 fatty acids may regulate gene expression by interacting with specific transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and liver X receptors (LXRs). alpha-Linolenic acid is found to be associated with isovaleric acidemia, which is an inborn error of metabolism.",HMDB0001388_nmroned_1692_31781.txt,nmroned,"alpha-linolenic acid (9,12,15)-linolenic acid (9z,12z,15z)-octadecatrienoic acid (z,z,z)-9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid 9-cis,12-cis,15-cis-octadecatrienoic acid ala all-cis-9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid cis,cis,cis-9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid cis-delta(9,12,15)-octadecatrienoic acid linolenic acid linolenate alpha-linolenate (9,12,15)-linolenate (9z,12z,15z)-octadecatrienoate (z,z,z)-9,12,15-octadecatrienoate 9,12,15-octadecatrienoate 9-cis,12-cis,15-cis-octadecatrienoate all-cis-9,12,15-octadecatrienoate cis,cis,cis-9,12,15-octadecatrienoate cis-delta(9,12,15)-octadecatrienoate cis-δ(9,12,15)-octadecatrienoate cis-δ(9,12,15)-octadecatrienoic acid a-linolenate a-linolenic acid α-linolenate α-linolenic acid alpha linolenic acid cis-9,12,15-octadecatrienoate cis-9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid industrene 120 fa(18:3(9z,12z,15z)) fa(18:3n3)"

Aaron B. Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958. In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and. lowering the body temperature. Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood,learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant. Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders(ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits. were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis.

PABA is an essential nutrient for some bacteria and is sometimes called vitamin Bx. However, PABA is not essential for humans and it varies in its activity from other B vitamins. PABA is sometimes marketed as an essential nutrient under the premise that it can stimulate intestinal bacteria. Certain bacteria in the human intestinal tract such as E. coli generate PABA from chorismate. Humans lack the enzymes to convert PABA into folate, and therefore require folate from dietary sources such as green leafy vegetables. Although some intestinal bacteria can synthesize folate from PABA and some E. coli can synthesize folate this requires six enzymatic activities in folate synthesis which are not all done in the same bacteria.

It is used to prevent and treat deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and is given as a subcutaneous injection. Enoxaparin binds to and accelerates the activity of antithrombin III. By activating antithrombin III, enoxaparin preferentially potentiates the inhibition of coagulation factors Xa and IIa. Factor Xa catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, so enoxaparin's inhibition of this process results in decreased thrombin and ultimately the prevention of fibrin clot formation.

Glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) has two anomers: the alpha anomer and the beta anomer. Glucose 6-phosphate is an ester of glucose with phosphoric acid, made in the course of glucose metabolism by mammalian and other cells. It is a normal constituent of resting muscle and probably is in constant equilibrium with fructose 6-phosphate (Stedman, 26th ed). When glucose enters a cell, it is immediately phosphorylated to G6P. This is catalyzed with hexokinase enzymes, thus consuming one ATP. A major reason for immediate phosphorylation of the glucose is so that it cannot diffuse out of the cell. The phosphorylation adds a charged group so the G6P cannot easily cross cell membranes. G6P can travel down two metabolic pathways: glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. In addition to the metabolic pathways, G6P can also be stored as glycogen in the liver if blood glucose levels are high. If the body needs energy or carbon skeletons for syntheses, G6P can be isomerized to fructose 6-phosphate and then phosphorylated to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Note, the molecule now has 2 phosphoryl groups attached. The addition of the 2nd phosphoryl group is an irreversible step, so once this happens G6P will enter glycolysis and be turned into pyruvate (ATP production occurs). If blood glucose levels are high, the body needs a way to store the excess glucose. After being converted to G6P, phosphoglucose mutase (an isomerase) can turn the molecule into glucose 1-phosphate. Glucose 1-phosphate can then be combined with uridine triphosphate (UTP) to form UDP-glucose. This reaction is driven by the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate that is released in the reaction. Now, the activated UDP-glucose can add to a growing glycogen molecule with the help of glycogen synthase. This is a very efficient storage mechanism for glucose since it costs the body only 1 ATP to store the 1 glucose molecule and virtually no energy to remove it from storage. It is important to note that glucose 6-phosphate is an allosteric activator of glycogen synthase, which makes sense because when the level of glucose is high the body should store the excess glucose as glycogen. On the other hand, glycogen synthase is inhibited when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase during times of high stress or low blood glucose levels.",HMDB0001401_nmroned_1698_31806.txt,nmroned,glucose 6-phosphate 6-o-phosphono-d-glucopyranose d-glucose 6-phosphate glc6p robison ester d-glucose 6-phosphoric acid glucose 6-phosphoric acid a-d-glucose 6- phosphate alpha-d-glucose 6- phosphate alpha-d-glucose 6-phosphate alpha-d-hexose 6-phosphate d(+)-glucopyranose 6-phosphate d-glucose-6-dihydrogen phosphate d-hexose 6-phosphate glucose-6-phosphate glucose 6-phosphate d-glucopyranose 6-phosphoric acid

PGD2 binds to the prostaglandin D2 receptor (PTGDR) which is a G-protein-coupled receptor. Its activity is mainly mediated by G-S proteins that stimulate adenylate cyclase resulting in an elevation of intracellular cAMP and Ca2+. PGD2 promotes sleep; regulates body temperature, olfactory function, hormone release, and nociception in the central nervous system; prevents platelet aggregation; and induces vasodilation and bronchoconstriction. PGD2 is also released from mast cells as an allergic and inflammatory mediator. Prostaglandin H2 is an unstable intermediate formed from PGG2 by the action of cyclooxygenase (COX) in the arachidonate cascade. In mammalian systems, it is efficiently converted into more stable arachidonate metabolites, such as PGD2, PGE2, PGF2a by the action of three groups of enzymes, PGD synthases (PGDS), PGE synthases and PGF synthases, respectively. PGDS catalyzes the isomerization of PGH2 to PGD2. Two types of PGD2 synthase are known. Lipocalin-type PGD synthase is present in cerebrospinal fluid, seminal plasma and may play an important role in male reproduction. Another PGD synthase, hematopoietic PGD synthase is present in the spleen, fallopian tube, endometrial gland cells, extravillous trophoblasts and villous trophoblasts, and perhaps plays an important role in female reproduction. Recent studies demonstrate that PGD2 is probably involved in multiple aspects of inflammation through its dual receptor systems, DP and CRTH2. (PMID:12148545)Prostaglandins are eicosanoids. The eicosanoids consist of the prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs), and lipoxins (LXs). The PGs and TXs are collectively identified as prostanoids. Prostaglandins were originally shown to be synthesized in the prostate gland, thromboxanes from platelets (thrombocytes), and leukotrienes from leukocytes, hence the derivation of their names. All mammalian cells except erythrocytes synthesize eicosanoids. These molecules are extremely potent, able to cause profound physiological effects at very dilute concentrations.

Putrescine has been identified as a uremic toxin according to the European Uremic Toxin Working Group (PMID:22626821). It is also found in semen. Putrescine attacks s-adenosyl methionine and converts it to spermidine. Spermidine in turn attacks another s-adenosyl methionine and converts it to spermine. Putrescine is synthesized in small quantities by healthy living cells by the action of ornithine decarboxylase. The polyamines, of which putrescine is one of the simplest, appear to be growth factors necessary for cell division. Putrescine apparently has specific role in skin physiology and neuroprotection. (PMID:15009201, 16364196). Pharmacological interventions have demonstrated convincingly that a steady supply of polyamines is a prerequisite for cell proliferation to occur. Genetic engineering of polyamine metabolism in transgenic rodents has shown that polyamines play a role in spermatogenesis, skin physiology, promotion of tumorigenesis and organ hypertrophy as well as neuronal protection. Transgenic activation of polyamine catabolism not only profoundly disturbs polyamine homeostasis in most tissues, but also creates a complex phenotype affecting skin, female fertility, fat depots, pancreatic integrity and regenerative growth. Transgenic expression of ornithine decarboxylase antizyme has suggested that this unique protein may act as a general tumor suppressor.

Pyridoxamine, also known as PM, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyridoxamine 5'-phosphates. These are heterocyclic aromatic compounds containing a pyridoxamine that carries a phosphate group at the 5'-position. Within humans, pyridoxamine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, pyridoxamine can be converted into pyridoxal; which is mediated by the enzyme pyridoxine-5'-phosphate oxidase. In addition, pyridoxamine can be converted into pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate; which is catalyzed by the enzyme pyridoxal kinase.

Alpha-lipoic acid is also known as thioctic acid. It is a naturally occurring compound that is synthesized by both plants and animals. Lipoic acid contains two thiol groups which may be either oxidized or reduced. The reduced form is known as dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA). Lipoic acid (Delta E= -0.288) is therefore capable of thiol-disulfide exchange, giving it antioxidant activity. Lipoate is a critical cofactor for aerobic metabolism, participating in the transfer of acyl or methylamine groups via the 2-Oxoacid dehydrogenase (2-OADH) or alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl CoA. This activity results in the catabolism of the branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine). Lipoic acid also participates in the glycine cleavage system(GCV). The glycine cleavage system is a multi-enzyme complex that catalyzes the oxidation of glycine to form 5,10 methylene tetrahydrofolate, an important cofactor in nucleic acid synthesis. Since Lipoic acid is an essential cofactor for many enzyme complexes, it is essential for aerobic life as we know it. This system is used by many organisms and plays a crucial role in the photosynthetic carbon cycle. Lipoic acid was first postulated to be an effective antioxidant when it was found it prevented vitamin C and vitamin E deficiency. It is able to scavenge reactive oxygen species and reduce other metabolites, such as glutathione or vitamins, maintaining a healthy cellular redox state. Lipoic acid has been shown in cell culture experiments to increase cellular uptake of glucose by recruiting the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the cell membrane, suggesting its use in diabetes. Studies of rat aging have suggested that the use of L-carnitine and lipoic acid results in improved memory performance and delayed structural mitochondrial decay.

Phosphocreatine undergoes irreversible cyclization and dehydration to form creatinine at a fractional rate of 0.026 per day, thus forming approximately 2 g creatinine/day in an adult male. This is the amount of creatine that must be provided either from dietary sources or by endogenous synthesis to maintain the body pool of (creatine and) phosphocreatine. Creatine is an amino acid that plays a vital role as phosphocreatine in regenerating adenosine triphosphate in skeletal muscle to energize muscle contraction. Creatine is phosphorylated to phosphocreatine in muscle in a reaction that is catalyzed by the enzyme creatine kinase. This enzyme is in highest concentration in muscle and nerve. Oral administration increases muscle stores. During the past decade, creatine has assumed prominence as an ergogenic (and legal) aid for professional and elite athletes. Most (~ 95%) of the total body creatine-phosphocreatine pool is in muscle (more in skeletal muscle than in smooth muscle) and amounts to 120 g (or 925 mmol) in a 70 kg adult male. Approximately 60-67% of the content in resting muscle is in the phosphorylated form. This generates enough ATP at the myofibrillar apparatus to power about 4 seconds of muscle contraction in exercise. Phosphocreatine reacts with ADP to yield ATP and creatine; the reversible reaction is catalyzed by creatine kinase. phosphocreatine is the chief store of high-energy phosphates in muscle. Thus, this reaction, which permits the rephosphorylation of ADP to ATP, is the immediate source of energy in muscle contraction. During rest, metabolic processes regenerate phosphocreatine stores. In normal muscle, ATP that is broken down to ADP is immediately rephosphorylated to ATP. Thus, phosphocreatine serves as a reservoir of ATP-synthesizing potential. phosphocreatine is the only fuel available to precipitously regenerate ATP during episodes of rapid fluctuations in demand. The availability of phosphocreatine likely limits muscle performance during brief, high-power exercise, i.e., maximal exercise of short duration. With near maximal isometric contraction, the rate of utilization of phosphocreatine declines after 1-2 seconds of contraction, prior to the glycolysis peak at approximately 3 seconds (PMID:10079702).",HMDB0001511_nmroned_1720_31901.txt,nmroned,phosphocreatine creatine phosphate creatine phosphic acid n-(n-phosphonoamido)sarcosine n-(phosphonoamidino)sarcosine n-phosphorylcreatine n(omega)-phosphonocreatine phosphorylcreatine {[imino(phosphonoamino)methyl](methyl)amino}acetic acid n-phosphocreatine creatine phosphoric acid {[imino(phosphonoamino)methyl](methyl)amino}acetate creatine-p creatine-phosphate creatinephosphoric acid n-(phosphonoamidino)-sarcosine n-phosphorocreatine n-[imino(phosphonoamino)methyl]-n-methyl-glycine neo-ton p-creatine

A nucleoside triphosphate is a molecule type that contains a nucleoside with three phosphates bound to it. dATP contains the sugar deoxyribose, a precursor to DNA synthesis whereby the two existing phosphate groups are cleaved with the remaining deoxyadenosine monophosphate being incorporated into DNA during replication. Due to its enzymatic incorporation into DNA, photoreactive dATP analogs such as N6-[4-azidobenzoyl–(2-aminoethyl)]-2′-deoxyadenosine-5′-triphosphate (AB-dATP) and N6-[4-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-diazirin-3-yl]benzoyl-(2-aminoethyl)]-2′-deoxyadenosine-5′-triphosphate (DB-dATP) have been used for DNA photoaffinity labeling. When present in sufficiently high levels, dATP can act as an immunotoxin and a metabotoxin. An immunotoxin disrupts, limits the function, or destroys immune cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenous metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of deoxyadenosine triphosphate are associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, an inborn error of metabolism. ADA deficiency damages the immune system and causes severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). People with SCID lack virtually all immune protection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi. They are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be very serious or life-threatening. These infections are often caused by ""opportunistic"" organisms that ordinarily do not cause illness in people with a normal immune system. The main symptoms of ADA deficiency are pneumonia, chronic diarrhea, and widespread skin rashes. The mechanism by which dATP functions as an immunotoxin is as follows: a buildup of dATP in cells inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and prevents DNA synthesis, so cells are unable to divide. Since developing T cells and B cells are some of the most mitotically active cells, they are unable to divide and propagate to respond to immune challenges.",HMDB0001532_nmroned_1724_31920.txt,nmroned,"deoxyadenosine triphosphate 2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate 2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphoric acid deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphoric acid deoxyadenosine triphosphoric acid 2'-deoxy-5'-atp 2'-deoxy-atp 2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate datp deoxy-atp deoxyadenosine-triphosphate 2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate, 14c-labeled 2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate, monomagnesium salt 2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate, trisodium salt 2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate, p'-(32)p-labeled datp cpd"

It is the simplest and smallest ketone. It is a colourless, highly volatile and flammable liquid with a characteristic pungent odour. Acetone is miscible with water and serves as an important organic solvent in its own right, in industry, home, and laboratory. Acetone is produced and disposed of in the human body through normal metabolic processes. It is normally present in blood and urine. People with diabetic ketoacidosis produce it in larger amounts. Acetone is not regarded as a waste product of metabolism. However, its physiological role in biochemical machinery is not clear. A model for the role of acetone metabolism is presented that orders the events occurring in acetonemia in sequence: in diabetic ketosis or starvation, ketone body production (b-hydroxy-butyrate, acetoacetate) provides fuel for vital organs (heart, brain, among others) raising the chance of survival of the metabolic catastrophe. However, when ketone body production exceeds the degrading capacity, the accumulating acetoacetic acid presents a new challenge to the pH regulatory system. Acetone production and its further degradation to C3 fragments fulfill two purposes: the maintenance of pH buffering capacity and provision of fuel for peripheral tissues. Since ketosis develops under serious metabolic circumstances, all the mechanisms that balance or moderate the effects of ketosis enhance the chance for survival. From this point of view, the theory that transportable C3 fragments can serve as additional nutrients is a novel view of acetone metabolism which introduces a new approach to the study of acetone degradation, especially in understanding its physiological function and the interrelationship between liver and peripheral tissues. (PMID 10580530). Acetone is typically derived from acetoacetate through the action of microbial acetoacetate decarboxylases found in gut microflora. In chemistry, acetone is the simplest representative of the ketones. Acetone is a colorless, mobile, flammable liquid readily soluble in water, ethanol, ether, etc., and itself serves as an important solvent.

Progesterone acts on the uterus, the mammary glands and the brain. It is required in embryo implantation, pregnancy maintenance, and the development of mammary tissue for milk production. Progesterone, converted from pregnenolone, also serves as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of gonadal steroid hormones and adrenal corticosteroids. Progesterone is a C-21 steroid hormone involved in the female menstrual cycle, pregnancy (supports gestation) and embryogenesis of humans and other species. Progesterone belongs to a class of hormones called progestagens, and is the major naturally occurring human progestagen. During implantation and gestation, progesterone appears to decrease the maternal immune response to allow for the acceptance of the pregnancy. Progesterone decreases contractility of the uterine smooth muscle. The fetus metabolizes placental progesterone in the production of adrenal mineralo- and glucosteroids.

Only the tetra-reduced form of the molecule serves as a coenzyme for C1 transfer reactions. In biological systems, the C1-units exist under various oxidation states and the different tetrahydrofolate derivatives constitute a family of related molecules named indistinctly under the generic term folate. (PMID 16042593). Folate is important for cells and tissues that rapidly divide. Cancer cells divide rapidly, and drugs that interfere with folate metabolism are used to treat cancer. Methotrexate is a drug often used to treat cancer because it inhibits the production of the active form, tetrahydrofolate. Unfortunately, methotrexate can be toxic, producing side effects such as inflammation in the digestive tract that make it difficult to eat normally. -- Wikipedia; Signs of folic acid deficiency are often subtle. Diarrhea, loss of appetite, and weight loss can occur. Additional signs are weakness, sore tongue, headaches, heart palpitations, irritability, and behavioral disorders. Women with folate deficiency who become pregnant are more likely to give birth to low birth weight and premature infants, and infants with neural tube defects. In adults, anemia is a sign of advanced folate deficiency. In infants and children, folate deficiency can slow growth rate. Some of these symptoms can also result from a variety of medical conditions other than folate deficiency. It is important to have a physician evaluate these symptoms so that appropriate medical care can be given. -- Wikipedia; Folinic acid is a form of folate that can help 'rescue' or reverse the toxic effects of methotrexate. Folinic acid is not the same as folic acid. Folic acid supplements have little established role in cancer chemotherapy. There have been cases of severe adverse effects of accidental substitution of folic acid for folinic acid in patients receiving methotrexate cancer chemotherapy. It is important for anyone receiving methotrexate to follow medical advice on the use of folic or folinic acid supplements. -- Wikipedia. Low concentrations of folate, vitamin B12, or vitamin B6 may increase the level of homocysteine, an amino acid normally found in blood. There is evidence that an elevated homocysteine level is an independent risk factor for heart disease and stroke. The evidence suggests that high levels of homocysteine may damage coronary arteries or make it easier for blood clotting cells called platelets to clump together and form a clot. However, there is currently no evidence available to suggest that lowering homocysteine with vitamins will reduce your risk of heart disease. Clinical intervention trials are needed to determine whether supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B12 or vitamin B6 can lower your risk of developing coronary heart disease. -- Wikipedia.",HMDB0001846_nmroned_5178_2733509.txt,nmroned,"tetrahydrofolic acid tetrahydrofolate (6s)-tetrahydrofolate (6s)-tetrahydrofolic acid 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid tetra-h-folate tetrahydrafolate tetrahydropteroyl mono-l-glutamate tetrahydropteroylglutamate"

Formally, caffeine belongs to the class of organic compounds known as xanthines. These are purine derivatives with a ketone group conjugated at carbons 2 and 6 of the purine moiety. Caffeine is chemically related to the adenine and guanine bases of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). It is found in the seeds, nuts, or leaves of a number of plants native to Africa, East Asia and South America and helps to protect them against predator insects and to prevent germination of nearby seeds. The most well-known source of caffeine is the coffee bean. Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychostimulant drug in the world. 85% of American adults consumed some form of caffeine daily, consuming 164 mg on average. Caffeine is mostly is consumed in the form of coffee. Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that reduces fatigue and drowsiness. At normal doses, caffeine has variable effects on learning and memory, but it generally improves reaction time, wakefulness, concentration, and motor coordination. Caffeine is a proven ergogenic aid in humans.  Caffeine improves athletic performance in aerobic (especially endurance sports) and anaerobic conditions. Moderate doses of caffeine (around 5 mg/kg) can improve sprint performance, cycling and running time trial performance, endurance and cycling power output (PMID: 32551869). At intake levels associated with coffee consumption, caffeine appears to exert most of its biological effects through the antagonism of the A1 and A2A subtypes of the adenosine receptor. Adenosine is an endogenous neuromodulator with mostly inhibitory effects, and adenosine antagonism by caffeine results in effects that are generally stimulatory. Some physiological effects associated with caffeine administration include central nervous system stimulation, acute elevation of blood pressure, increased metabolic rate, and diuresis. A number of in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that caffeine modulates both innate and adaptive immune responses. For instance, studies indicate that caffeine and its major metabolite paraxanthine suppress neutrophil and monocyte chemotaxis, and also suppress production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha from human blood. Caffeine has also been reported to suppress human lymphocyte function as indicated by reduced T-cell proliferation and impaired production of Th1 (interleukin [IL]-2 and interferon [IFN]-gamma), Th2 (IL-4, IL-5) and Th3 (IL-10) cytokines. Studies also indicate that caffeine suppresses antibody production. The evidence suggests that at least some of the immunomodulatory actions of caffeine are mediated via inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-phosphodiesterase (PDE), and consequential increase in intracellular cAMP concentrations. Overall, these studies indicate that caffeine, like other members of the methylxanthine family, is largely anti-inflammatory in nature, and based on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine, many of its immunomodulatory effects occur at concentrations that are relevant to normal human consumption. (PMID: 16540173). Caffeine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed in the stomach and small intestine and distributed to all tissues, including the brain. Caffeine metabolism occurs primarily in the liver, where the activity of the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP1A2 accounts for almost 95% of the primary metabolism of caffeine. CYP1A2-catalyzed 3-demethylation of caffeine results in the formation of 1,7-dimethylxanthine (paraxanthine). Paraxanthine may be demethylated by CYP1A2 to form 1-methylxanthine, which may be oxidized to 1-methyluric acid by xanthine oxidase. Paraxanthine may also be hydroxylated by CYP2A6 to form 1,7-dimethyluric acid, or acetylated by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) to form 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil, an unstable compound that may be deformylated nonenzymatically to form 5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil. Caffeine concentrations in coffee beverages can be quite variable. A standard cup of coffee is often assumed to provide 100 mg of caffeine, but a recent analysis of 14 different specialty coffees purchased at coffee shops in the US found that the amount of caffeine in 8 oz (=240 ml) of brewed coffee ranged from 72 to 130 mg. Caffeine in espresso coffees ranged from 58 to 76 mg in a single shot. (PMID: 16507475).

Methylated purines originate from the metabolism of methylxanthines (caffeine, theophylline and theobromine). Methyluric acids are indistinguishable from uric acid by simple methods routinely used in clinical laboratories, requiring the use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Purine derivatives in urinary calculi could be considered markers of abnormal purine metabolism. The content of a purine derivative in stone depends on its average urinary excretion in the general population, similarity to the chemical structure of uric acid, and content of the latter in stone. This suggests that purines in stones represent a solid solution with uric acid as solvent. It is also plausible that methylxanthines, ubiquitous components of the diet and drugs, are involved in the pathogenesis of urolithiasis. Caffeine is metabolized via successive pathways mainly catalyzed by CYP1A2, xanthine oxidase or N-acetyltransferase-2 to give 14 different metabolites. CYP1A2 activity shows an inter-individual variability among the population. CYP1A2, an isoform of the CYP1A cytochrome P450 super-family, is involved in the metabolism of many drugs and plays a potentially important role in the induction of chemical carcinogenesis.

P-cresol is a cresol that consists of toluene substituted by a hydroxy group at position 4. It is a metabolite of aromatic amino acid metabolism produced by intestinal microflora in humans and animals. It has a role as a uremic toxin, a human metabolite and an Escherichia coli metabolite. It is a colourless solid that is widely used intermediate in the production of other chemicals. It is a derivative of phenol and is an isomer of o-cresol and m-cresol. It is a partially lipophilic moiety which strongly binds to plasma protein (close to 100%) under normal conditions. p-Cresol is metabolized through conjugation, mainly sulphation and glucuronization, but removal of the unconjugated p-cresol is, at least in part, via the urine. Therefore it is not surprising that this compound, together with several other phenoles, is retained when the kidneys fail. P-Cresol is an end-product of protein breakdown, and an increase of the nutritional protein load in healthy individuals results in enhanced generation and urinary excretion. The serum p-cresol concentration in uremic patients can be decreased by changing to a low-protein diet. p-Cresol is one of the metabolites of the amino acid tyrosine, and to a certain extent also of phenylalanine, which are converted to 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid by intestinal bacteria, before being decarboxylated to p-cresol (putrefaction). The main contributing bacteria are aerobes (mainly enterobacteria), but to a certain extent also anaerobes play a role (mainly Clostridium perfringens). In uremia, modifications in the intestinal flora result in the specific overgrowth of bacteria that are specific p-cresol producers. The administration of antibiotics reduces urinary excretion of p-cresol, as a result of the liquidation of the producing bacteria. Environmental factors might also contribute. The liver cytochrome P450 metabolizes toluene to benzyl alcohol, but also to o-cresol and p-cresol. Toluene is not only used industrially, but it is also the most widely abusively inhaled solvent. Furthermore, p-cresol is a metabolite of menthofuran, one of the metabolites of R-(+)-pulegone, which is found in extracts from the plants Mentha pulegium and Hedeoma pulegioides, commonly known as pennyroyal oil and pennyroyal tea. These extracts are popular as unconventional herbal therapeutic agents and are applied as abortiva, diaphoretics, emmenagogues, and psychedelic drugs. Pennyroyal oil is extensively used for its pleasant mint-like smell in the flavoring industry. The toxicity of pennyroyal oil and menthofuran is well known. Another compound used in traditional medicine, especially in Japan, which is a precursor of p-cresol is wood tar creosote. p-Cresol has been reported to affect several biochemical, biological and physiological functions: (i) it diminishes the oxygen uptake of rat cerebral cortex slices; (ii) it increases the free active drug concentration of warfarin and diazepam; (iii) it has been related to growth retardation in the weanling pig; (iv) it alters cell membrane permeability, at least in bacteria; (v) it induces LDH leakage from rat liver slices; (vi) it induces susceptibility to auditive epileptic crises; and (vii) it blocks cell K+ channels. (PMID:10570076). p-Cresol is a uremic toxin that is at least partially removed by peritoneal dialysis in haemodialysis patients, and has been involved in the progression of renal failure (PMID:11169029). At concentrations encountered during uremia, p-cresol inhibits phagocyte function and decreases leukocyte adhesion to cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells. (PMID:14681860). p-Cresol can be found in Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Enterobacter and Lactobacillus (PMID:2394806; PMID:30208103).

excellent tolerability of therapeutic doses of paracetamol (acetaminophen) is a major factor in the very wide use of the drug. The major problem in the use of paracetamol is its hepatotoxicity after an overdose. Hepatotoxicity has also been reported after therapeutic doses, but critical analysis indicates that most patients with alleged toxicity from therapeutic doses have taken overdoses. Importantly, prospective studies indicate that therapeutic doses of paracetamol are an unlikely cause of hepatotoxicity in patients who ingest moderate to large amounts of alcohol (PMID: 15733027). Single doses of paracetamol are effective analgesics for acute postoperative pain and give rise to few adverse effects (PMID: 14974073). Acetaminophen (AAP) overdose and the resulting hepatotoxicity is an important clinical problem. In addition, AAP is widely used as a prototype hepatotoxin to study mechanisms of chemical-induced cell injury and to test the hepatoprotective potential of new drugs and herbal medicines. Because of its importance, the mechanisms of AAP-induced liver cell injury have been extensively investigated and controversially discussed for many years (PMID:

Green tea is manufactured from fresh, unfermented tea leaves; the oxidation of catechins is minimal, and hence they are able to serve as antioxidants. Researchers believe that catechin is effective because it easily sticks to proteins, blocking bacteria from adhering to cell walls and disrupting their ability to destroy them. Viruses have hooks on their surfaces and can attach to cell walls. The catechin in green tea prevents viruses from adhering and causing harm.

Aspirin or acetylsalicylic acid (acetosal) is a drug in the family of salicylates, often used as an analgesic (against minor pains and aches), antipyretic (against fever), and anti-inflammatory. It has also an anticoagulant effect and is used in long-term low-doses to prevent heart attacks and cancer. It was isolated from meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria, formerly classified as Spiraea ulmaria) by German researchers in 1839. While their extract was somewhat effective, it also caused digestive problems such as irritated stomach and diarrhoea, and even death when consumed in high doses. In 1853, a French chemist named Charles Frederic Gerhardt neutralized salicylic acid by buffering it with sodium (sodium salicylate) and acetyl chloride, creating acetosalicylic anhydride. Gerhardt's product worked, but he had no desire to market it and abandoned his discovery. In 1897, researcher Arthur Eichengrun and Felix Hoffmann, a research assistant at Friedrich Bayer & Co. in Germany, derivatized one of the hydroxyl functional groups in salicylic acid with an acetyl group (forming the acetyl ester), which greatly reduced the negative effects. This was the first synthetic drug, not a copy of something that existed in nature, and the start of the pharmaceuticals industry. The name 'aspirin' is composed of a- (from the acetyl group) -spir- (from the plant genus Spiraea) and -in (a common ending for drugs at the time). It has also been stated that the name originated by another means. As referring to AcetylSalicylic and 'pir' in reference to one of the scientists who was able to isolate it in crystalline form, Raffaele Piria. Finally 'in' due to the same reasons as stated above. Salicylic acid (which is a naturally occurring substance found in many plants) can be acetylated using acetic anhydride, yielding aspirin and acetic acid as a byproduct. It is a common experiment performed in organic chemistry labs, and generally tends to produce low yields due to the relative difficulty of its extraction from an aqueous state. The trick to getting the reaction to work is to acidify with phosphoric acid and heat the reagents under reflux with a boiling water bath for between 40 minutes and an hour. Aspirin acts as an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase which results in the inhibition of the biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Aspirin also inhibits platelet aggregation and is used in the prevention of arterial and venous thrombosis.

It is manufactured by the hydration of propylene oxide. Propylene glycol is used as a solvent for intravenous, oral, and topical pharmaceutical preparations It is generally considered safe. However, in large doses, it can be toxic, especially if given over a short period of time. Intravenous lorazepam contains the largest amount of propylene glycol of commonly used drugs. In adults with normal liver and kidney function, the terminal half-life of propylene glycol ranges from 1.4 to 3.3 hours. Propylene glycol is metabolized by the liver to form lactate, acetate, and pyruvate. The nonmetabolized drug is excreted in the urine mainly as the glucuronide conjugate, approximately 12 to 45 percent is excreted unchanged in urine. Renal clearance decreases as the dose administered increases (390 ml/minute/173 m2 at a dose of 5 g/day but only 144 ml/minute/173 m2 at a dose of 21 g/day). These data suggest that renal clearance declines at higher propylene glycol doses because of the saturation of proximal tubular secretion of the drug. As an acceptable level of propylene glycol has not been defined, the clinical implication of a propylene glycol level is unclear. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a maximum consumption of 25 mg/kg/day (1.8 g/day for a 75 kg male) of propylene glycol when used as a food additive, but this limit does not address its use as a drug solvent. No maximum dose is recommended in the literature for intravenous therapy with propylene glycol. Intoxication occurs at much higher doses than the WHO dose limit and is exclusive to pharmacologic exposure. Propylene glycol toxicity includes the development of serum hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, and kidney failure. It has been suggested that proximal tubular necrosis is the cause of acute kidney injury from propylene glycol. Along these lines, proximal tubular cell injury occurs in cultured human cells exposed to propylene glycol. Acute tubular necrosis was described with propylene glycol toxicity in a case of concomitant administration of intravenous lorazepam and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole. Propylene glycol induced intoxication can also mimic sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Patients suspected of having sepsis with negative cultures should be evaluated for propylene glycol toxicity if they have been exposed to high dose lorazepam or other medications containing this solvent (PMID:17555487).",HMDB0001881_nmroned_5264_2734714.txt,nmroned,"propylene glycol (r)-1,2-propanediol r-1,2-propanediol (r)-propylene glycol (-)-1,2-propanediol (-)-propylene glycol (2r)-1,2-propanediol (2r)-propane-1,2-diol (r)-(-)-1,2-propanediol (r)-2-hydroxy-1-propanol 1,2-(rs)-propanediol 1,2-dihydroxypropane 1,2-propanediol 1,2-propylene glycol 1-deoxy-sn-glycerol 2,3-propanediol 2-hydroxypropanol d-(-)-propanediol isopropylene glycol methylethyl glycol methylethylene glycol monopropylene glycol propylene glycol r-(-)-1,2-propanediol r-(-)-propylene glycol alpha-propylene glycol α-propylene glycol"

N-Acetylcysteine is the N-acetyl derivative of the amino acid L-cysteine and is a precursor in the formation of the antioxidant glutathione in the body. N-Acetylcysteine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as N-acyl-alpha amino acids. N-acyl-alpha amino acids are compounds containing an alpha amino acid which bears an acyl group at its terminal nitrogen atom. N-Acetyl-L-cysteine can also be classified as an alpha amino acid or a derivatized alpha amino acid. Technically, N-Acetyl-L-cysteine is a biologically available N-terminal capped form of the proteinogenic alpha amino acid L-cysteine. N-acetyl amino acids can be produced either via direct synthesis of specific N-acetyltransferases or via the proteolytic degradation of N-acetylated proteins by specific hydrolases. N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a widespread and highly conserved process in eukaryotes that is involved in protection and stability of proteins (PMID: 16465618).  About 85% of all human proteins and 68% of all yeast proteins are acetylated at their N-terminus (PMID: 21750686). Several proteins from prokaryotes and archaea are also modified by N-terminal acetylation. The majority of eukaryotic N-terminal-acetylation reactions occur through N-acetyltransferase enzymes or NAT‚Äôs (PMID: 30054468).  These enzymes consist of three main oligomeric complexes NatA, NatB, and NatC, which are composed of at least a unique catalytic subunit and one unique ribosomal anchor. The substrate specificities of different NAT enzymes are mainly determined by the identities of the first two N-terminal residues of the target protein. The human NatA complex co-translationally acetylates N-termini that bear a small amino acid (A, S, T, C, and occasionally V and G) (PMID: 30054468). NatA also exists in a monomeric state and can post-translationally acetylate acidic N-termini residues (D-, E-). NatB and NatC acetylate N-terminal methionine with further specificity determined by the identity of the second amino acid. . N-acetylated amino acids, such as N-acetylcysteine can be released by an N-acylpeptide hydrolase from peptides generated by proteolytic degradation (PMID: 16465618). In addition to the NAT enzymes and protein-based acetylation, N-acetylation of free cysteine can also occur. The enzyme known as cysteine-S-conjugate N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.80) catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group of acetyl CoA to the amino group of cysteine. This enzyme is an important participant in glutathione metabolism and the production of glutathione. The thiol (sulfhydryl) group in N-Acetylcysteine confers antioxidant effects and is able to reduce free radicals. N-Acetylcysteine is a pharmacological agent used in the management of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdoses. When acetaminophen is taken in large quantities, a minor metabolite called N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) accumulates within the body. NAPQI is normally conjugated by glutathione, but when taken in excess, the body's glutathione reserves are not sufficient to deactivate the toxic NAPQI. In the treatment of acetaminophen overdose, N-acetylcysteine acts to maintain or replenish depleted glutathione reserves in the liver and enhance non-toxic metabolism of acetaminophen. These actions serve to protect liver cells from NAPQI toxicity. For this particular indication, N-acetylcysteine is available under the trade names Mucomyst (Bristol-Myers Squibb) and Parvolex (GSK). N-Acetylcysteine is also used as a mucolytic agent to reduce the viscosity of mucous secretions. It has also been shown to have antiviral effects in patients with HIV due to inhibition of viral stimulation by reactive oxygen intermediates. Acetylcysteine has been studied for a number of psychiatric disorders.

It has a role as an antiinfective agent, an antifungal agent, a keratolytic drug, an EC 1.11.1.11 (L-ascorbate peroxidase) inhibitor, a plant metabolite, an algal metabolite and a plant hormone. It is a conjugate acid of a salicylate. It is a colorless solid, it is a precursor to and a metabolite of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). It is a plant hormone. The name is from Latin salix for willow tree. It is an ingredient in some anti-acne products. Salts and esters of salicylic acid are known as salicylates. Salicylic acid modulates COX1 enzymatic activity to decrease the formation of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. Salicylate may competitively inhibit prostaglandin formation. Salicylate's antirheumatic (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory) actions are a result of its analgesic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Salicylic acid works by causing the cells of the epidermis to slough off more readily, preventing pores from clogging up, and allowing room for new cell growth. Salicylic acid inhibits the oxidation of uridine-5-diphosphoglucose (UDPG) competitively with nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide and noncompetitively with UDPG. It also competitively inhibits the transferring of glucuronyl group of uridine-5-phosphoglucuronic acid to the phenolic acceptor. The wound-healing retardation action of salicylates is probably due mainly to its inhibitory action on mucopolysaccharide synthesis.

Nonetheless, this reaction may also be encountered with atenolol, particularly with high doses. Extreme caution should be exerted if atenolol is given to asthma patients, who are particularly at risk; the dose should be as low as possible. If an asthma attack occurs, the inhalation of a beta2-mimetic antiasthmatic, such as hexoprenalin or salbutamol, will usually suppress the symptoms. Atenolol (trade name Tenormin) can be used to treat cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, arrhythmias, and treatment of myocardial infarction after the acute event. Patients with compensated congestive heart failure may be treated with atenolol as a co medication (usually together with an ACE inhibitor, a diuretic and a digitalis-glycoside, if indicated).

It has high estrogenic potency when administered orally, and is often used as the estrogenic component in oral contraceptives. -- Pubchem; estradiol (17-beta estradiol) (also oestradiol) is a sex hormone. Labelled the ""female"" hormone but also present in males it represents the major estrogen in humans. Critical for sexual functioning, estradiol also supports bone growth. -- Wikipedia; One of the fascinating twists to mammalian sexual differentiation is that estradiol is one of the two active metabolites of testosterone in males (the other being dihydrotestosterone). estradiol cannot be transferred readily from the circulation into the brain. Since fetuses of both sexes are exposed to similarly high levels of maternal estradiol, it can play little role in prenatal sexual differentiation. However, testosterone enters the central nervous system more freely and significant amounts are aromatized to estradiol within the brain of most male mammals, including humans. There is now much evidence that the programming of adult male sexual behavior in ""lower mammals,"" (such as mounting rather than lordosis behavior), is largely dependent on estradiol produced in the central nervous system during prenatal life and early infancy from testosterone. We do not yet know whether this process plays a minimal or significant part in human sexual behaviors. -- Wikipedia; A synthetic form of estradiol, called ethinyl estradiol is a major component of hormonal contraceptive devices. Combined oral contraceptives contain ethinyl estradiol and a progestin, which both contribute to the inhibition of GnRH, LH, and FSH.

Nicotine alkaloids are also found in the leaves of the coca plant. Nicotine constitutes 0.3 to 5% of the tobacco plant by dry weight, with biosynthesis taking place in the root and accumulation in the leaves. It is a potent neurotoxin with particular specificity to insects; therefore nicotine was widely used as an insecticide in the past and nicotine derivatives such as imidacloprid continue to be widely used. It has been noted that the majority of people diagnosed with schizophrenia smoke tobacco. Estimates for the number of schizophrenics that smoke range from 75% to 90%. It was recently argued that the increased level of smoking in schizophrenia may be due to a desire to self-medicate with nicotine. More recent research has found the reverse: it is a risk factor without long-term benefit, used only for its short-term effects. However, research on nicotine as administered through a patch or gum is ongoing. As nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through the bloodstream and can cross the blood-brain barrier. On average, it takes about seven seconds for the substance to reach the brain. The half-life of nicotine in the body is around 2 hours. The amount of nicotine inhaled with tobacco smoke is a fraction of the amount contained in the tobacco leaves (most of the substance is destroyed by the heat). The amount of nicotine absorbed by the body from smoking depends on many factors, including the type of tobacco, whether the smoke is inhaled, and whether a filter is used. For chewing tobacco, often called dip, snuff, or sinus, which is held in the mouth between the lip and gum, the amount released into the body tends to be much greater than smoked tobacco. The currently available literature indicates that nicotine, on its own, does not promote the development of cancer in healthy tissue and has no mutagenic properties. Its teratogenic properties have not yet been adequately researched, and while the likelihood of birth defects caused by nicotine is believed to be very small or nonexistent, nicotine replacement product manufacturers recommend consultation with a physician before using a nicotine patch or nicotine gum while pregnant or nursing. However, nicotine and the increased acetylcholinic activity it causes have been shown to impede apoptosis, which is one of the methods by which the body destroys unwanted cells (programmed cell death). Since apoptosis helps to remove mutated or damaged cells that may eventually become cancerous, the inhibitory actions of nicotine create a more favourable environment for cancer to develop. Thus, nicotine plays an indirect role in carcinogenesis. It is also important to note that its addictive properties are often the primary motivating factor for tobacco smoking, contributing to the proliferation of cancer. Nicotine is a highly toxic alkaloid. It is the prototypical agonist at nicotinic cholinergic receptors where it dramatically stimulates neurons and ultimately blocks synaptic transmission. Nicotine is also important medically because of its presence in tobacco smoke. Nicotine is a hygroscopic, oily liquid that is miscible with water in its base form. As a nitrogenous base, nicotine forms salts with acids that are usually solid and water soluble. Nicotine easily penetrates the skin. As shown by the physical data, free base nicotine will burn at a temperature below its boiling point, and its vapours will combust at 95 °C in the air despite a low vapour pressure. Because of this, most nicotine is burned when a cigarette is smoked; however, enough is inhaled to provide the desired effects. Nicotine is a stimulant drug that acts as an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These are ionotropic receptors composed of five homomeric or heteromeric subunits. In the brain, nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on dopaminergic neurons in the cortico-limbic pathways. This causes the channel to open and allow conductance of multiple cations including sodium, calcium, and potassium. This leads to depolarization, which activates voltage-gated calcium channels and allows more calcium to enter the axon terminal. Calcium stimulates vesicle trafficking towards the plasma membrane and the release of dopamine into the synapse. Dopamine binding to its receptors is responsible for the euphoric and addictive properties of nicotine. Nicotine also binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. Binding opens the ion channel allowing an influx of sodium which causes depolarization of the cell and activates voltage-gated calcium channels. Calcium triggers the release of epinephrine from intracellular vesicles into the bloodstream, which causes vasoconstriction, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, and increased blood sugar. Cotinine is a byproduct of the metabolism of nicotine which remains in the blood for up to 48 hours and can be used as an indicator of a person's exposure to smoke. In high doses, nicotine will cause a blocking of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is the reason for its toxicity and its effectiveness as an insecticide. In lower concentrations, the substance acts as a stimulant in mammals and is one of the main factors responsible for the dependence-forming and energy-boosting properties of tobacco smoking.",HMDB0001934_nmroned_1812_32699.txt,nmroned,"nicotine (-)-nicotine (-)-3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidyl)pyridine (-)-3-(n-methylpyrrolidino)pyridine (r)-3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)pyridine (s)-(-)-nicotine (s)-3-(1-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl)pyridine (s)-3-(n-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl)pyridine 1-methyl-2-(3-pyridyl)pyrrolidine 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrollidinyl)pyridine 3-(1-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl)pyridine 3-(2-(n-methylpyrrolidinyl))pyridine 3-(n-methylpyrollidino)pyridine l(-)-nicotine l-3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidyl)pyridine l-nicotine (s)-nicotine habitrol (+)-nicotine (r,s)-nicotine 1-methyl-2-(3-pyridal)-pyrrolidene 1-methyl-2-(3-pyridal)-pyrrolidine 1-methyl-2-(3-pyridiyl)pyrrolidine 2'-beta-h-nicotine 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-pyridine 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)pyridine 3-(n-methylpyrrolidino)pyridine 3-n-methylpyrrolidine a -n-methylpyrrolidine a-n-methylpyrrolidine alpha-n-methylpyrrolidine beta-pyridyl-alpha-n-methylpyrrolidine d-nicotine delta-nicotine destruxol dl-tetrahydronicotyrine fumeto bac methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)pyridine nicoderm nicotine polacrilex r)-(+)-nicotine tartrate, nicotine nicotine bitartrate nicotine tartrate bitartrate, nicotine nicotine"

It has a role as a sympathomimetic agent, an anti-asthmatic drug, a bronchodilator agent, a vasoconstrictor agent, a central nervous system drug, a nasal decongestant, a xenobiotic and a plant metabolite. It is a secondary alcohol, a secondary amino compound and a member of phenylethanolamines. It is a conjugate base of a pseudoephedrine(1+). Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes. It may be used as a nasal/sinus decongestant, as a stimulant, or as a wakefulness-promoting agent in higher doses. It was first characterized in 1889, by the German chemists Ladenburg and Oelschlägel, who used a sample that had been isolated from Ephedra vulgaris by the Merck pharmaceutical corporation of Darmstadt, Germany. The salts pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine sulfate are found in many over-the-counter preparations, either as a single ingredient or (more commonly) in a fixed-dose combination with one or more additional active ingredients such as antihistamines, guaifenesin, dextromethorphan, paracetamol (acetaminophen) or an NSAID (such as aspirin or ibuprofen). At first, pseudoephedrine was known as a natural substance that occurs in shrubs of the Ephedra genus, which grow worldwide. Almost all commercial pseudoephedrine, however, is produced by fermenting dextrose in the presence of benzaldehyde. The primary product, (R)-phenylacetylcarbinol, is aminated to make pseudoephedrine. Pseudoephedrine acts on α- and β2-adrenergic receptors, to cause vasoconstriction and relaxation of smooth muscle in the bronchi, respectively. α-Adrenergic receptors are located on the muscles lining the walls of blood vessels. When these receptors are activated, the muscles contract, causing the blood vessels to constrict (vasoconstriction). The constricted blood vessels now allow less fluid to leave the blood vessels and enter the nose, throat and sinus linings, which results in decreased inflammation of nasal membranes, as well as decreased mucus production. Thus, by constriction of blood vessels, mainly those located in the nasal passages, pseudoephedrine causes a decrease in the symptoms of nasal congestion. Activation of β2-adrenergic receptors produces relaxation of smooth muscle of the bronchi, causing bronchial dilation and in turn decreasing congestion (although not fluid) and difficulty breathing.

Methylated purines originate from the metabolism of methylxanthines (caffeine, theophylline and theobromine). Methyluric acids are indistinguishable from uric acid by simple methods routinely used in clinical laboratories, requiring the use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Purine derivatives in urinary calculi could be considered markers of abnormal purine metabolism. The content of a purine derivative in stone depends on its average urinary excretion in the general population, similarity to the chemical structure of uric acid, and content of the latter in stone. This suggests that purines in stones represent a solid solution with uric acid as solvent. It is also plausible that methylxanthines, ubiquitous components of the diet and drugs, are involved in the pathogenesis of urolithiasis.

Cresols are organic compounds which are methylphenols. They are a widely occurring natural and manufactured group of aromatic organic compounds which are categorized as phenols (sometimes called phenolics). Depending on the temperature, cresols can be solid or liquid because they have melting points not far from room temperature. Like other types of phenols, they are slowly oxidized by long exposure to air and the impurities often give cresols a yellowish to brownish red tint. Cresols have an odor characteristic to that of other simple phenols, reminiscent to some of a ""medicine"" smell. Cresol solutions are used as household cleaners and disinfectants, perhaps most famously under the trade name Lysol. In the past, cresol solutions have been used as antiseptics in surgery, but they have been largely displaced in this role by less toxic compounds. Lysol was also advertised as a disinfecting vaginal douche in mid-twentieth century America. Cresols are found in many foods and in wood and tobacco smoke, crude oil, coal tar, and in brown mixtures such as creosote and cresylic acids, which are wood preservatives. Small organisms in soil and water produce cresols when they break down materials in the environment. Most exposures to cresols are at very low levels that are not harmful. When cresols are breathed, ingested, or applied to the skin at very high levels, they can be very harmful. Effects observed in people include irritation and burning of skin, eyes, mouth, and throat; abdominal pain and vomiting; heart damage; anemia; liver and kidney damage; facial paralysis; coma; and death. Breathing high levels of cresols for a short time results in irritation of the nose and throat. Aside from these effects, very little is known about the effects of breathing cresols, for example, at lower levels over longer times. Ingesting high levels results in kidney problems, mouth and throat burns, abdominal pain, vomiting, and effects on the blood and nervous system.

Gallic acid and derivatives are compounds containing a 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid moiety. Outside of the human body, Syringic acid is found, on average, in the highest concentration within a few different foods, such as common walnuts, swiss chards, and olives and in a lower concentration in apples, tarragons, and peanuts. Syringic acid has also been detected, but not quantified in several different foods, such as sweet marjorams, silver lindens, bulgurs, annual wild rices, and barley. This could make syringic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of these foods. Syringic acid is correlated with high antioxidant activity and inhibition of LDL oxidation. Research suggests that phenolics from wine may play a positive role against oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which is a key step in the development of atherosclerosis.

It has a role as a fungal metabolite and a human metabolite. It is a dicarboxylic acid and an olefinic compound. It derives from a succinic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an itaconate(2-). This dicarboxylic acid is a white solid that is soluble in water, ethanol, and acetone. Historically, itaconic acid was obtained by the distillation of citric acid, but currently it is produced by fermentation. The name itaconic acid was devised as an anagram of aconitic acid, another derivative of citric acid. Itaconic acid, also known as itaconate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as branched fatty acids. These are fatty acids containing a branched chain. Itaconic acid is a very hydrophobic molecule, practically insoluble in water, and relatively neutral. Since the 1960s, it is produced industrially by the fermentation of carbohydrates such as glucose or molasses using fungi such as Aspergillus itaconicus or Aspergillus terreus. For A. terreus the itaconate pathway is mostly elucidated. The generally accepted route for itaconate is via glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and a decarboxylation of cis-aconitate to itaconate via cis-aconitate-decarboxylase. The smut fungus Ustilago maydis uses an alternative route. Cis-aconitate is converted to the thermodynamically favoured trans-aconitate via aconitate-Δ-isomerase (Adi1). trans-Aconitate is further decarboxylated to itaconate by trans-aconitate-decarboxylase (Tad1). Itaconic acid is also produced in cells of macrophage lineage. It was shown that itaconate is a covalent inhibitor of the enzyme isocitrate lyase in vitro. As such, itaconate may possess antibacterial activities against bacteria expressing isocitrate lyase (such as Salmonella enterica and Mycobacterium tuberculosis). It is also sythesized in the laboratory, where dry distillation of citric acid affords itaconic anhydride, which undergoes hydrolysis to itaconic acid.",HMDB0002092_nmroned_1850_32858.txt,nmroned,"itaconic acid 2-methylenesuccinic acid 2-propene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid methylenebutanedioic acid methylenesuccinic acid propylenedicarboxylic acid 2-methylenesuccinate 2-propene-1,2-dicarboxylate methylenebutanedioate methylenesuccinate propylenedicarboxylate itaconate 2-hydroxy-3-naphthoyl-2-naphthylamine itaconic acid, copper salt itaconic acid, disodium salt itaconic acid, calcium salt itaconic acid, sodium salt"

Methylated purines originate from the metabolism of methylxanthines (caffeine, theophylline and theobromine). Methyluric acids are indistinguishable from uric acid by simple methods routinely used in clinical laboratories, requiring the use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Purine derivatives in urinary calculi could be considered markers of abnormal purine metabolism. The content of a purine derivative in stone depends on its average urinary excretion in the general population, similarity to the chemical structure of uric acid, and content of the latter in stone. This suggests that purines in stones represent a solid solution with uric acid as solvent. It is also plausible that methylxanthines, ubiquitous components of the diet and drugs, are involved in the pathogenesis of urolithiasis. Caffeine is metabolized via successive pathways mainly catalyzed by CYP1A2, xanthine oxidase or N-acetyltransferase-2 to give 14 different metabolites. CYP1A2 activity shows an inter-individual variability among the population. CYP1A2, an isoform of the CYP1A cytochrome P450 super-family, is involved in the metabolism of many drugs and plays a potentially important role in the induction of chemical carcinogenesis.

The concerted action of IFNgamma and picolinic acid on MIP-1alpha/beta chemokine/receptor system is likely to be of pathophysiological significance and to represent an important regulatory mechanism for leukocyte recruitment and distribution into damaged tissues during inflammatory responses. Picolinic acid has an effect on the production of L-arginine-derived reactive nitrogen intermediates in macrophages, by augmenting IFN-gamma-induced NO2- production, and acts synergistically with IFN-gamma in activating macrophages.

It is endogenously produced by human microbiota and has only been detected in vivo (PMID:19234110). While many microbial metabolites produced in the gut are toxic or act as uremic toxins (when they are reabsorbed through the gut epithelia), indole-3-propionic acid is a very beneficial microbial metabolite (PMID:30914514, 30862081, 29238104). In limited studies, urinary IPA correlates positively with disease and it remains unclear if this represents host bacteria responding to pathology via the production of IPA, or intestinal permeability changes leading to higher absorption and excretion of IPA, or inflammatory changes within kidneys leading to high excretion of IPA (PMID:32132996). Indole-3-propionic acid is a remarkably strong antioxidant (PMID:10721080). It is an even more potent scavenger of hydroxyl radicals than melatonin, the most potent scavenger of hydroxyl radicals synthesized by the human body. Similar to melatonin but unlike other antioxidants, indole-3-propionic acid scavenges radicals without subsequently generating reactive and pro-oxidant intermediate compounds (PMID:9928448, 10419516). Indole-3-propionic acid has been shown to prevent oxidative stress and the death of primary neurons and neuroblastoma cells exposed to the amyloid beta-protein in the form of amyloid fibrils, one of the most prominent neuropathologic features of Alzheimer's disease. 3-Indolepropionic acid also shows a strong level of neuroprotection in two other paradigms of oxidative stress. (PMID 10419516) More recently it has been found that higher indole-3-propionic acid levels in serum/plasma are associated with a reduced likelihood of type 2 diabetes and with higher levels of consumption of fibre-rich foods (PMID:28397877). Studies have shown that serum levels of indole-3-propionic acid are positively correlated with dietary fibre intake and negatively correlated with C-reactive protein levels (PMID:29795366). Indole-3-propionic acid is a marker for the presence of Clostridium sporogenes in the gut. Higher levels are associated with higher levels of Clostridium sporogenes (PMID:7378938). In addition to its useful physiological role in mammals, indole-3-propionic acid is a plant hormone with functions similar to indole-3-acetic acid (or IAA), the major plant auxin. Recent studies have shed some light on additional mechanisms of action of IPA. In the intestine, IPA could serve as a ligand to an adopted orphan nuclear receptor, Pregnane X receptor (PXR) and act as an anti-inflammatory agent (PMID:25065623). This property has allowed investigators to develop more potent analogs targeting PXR (PMID:32153125).

Pentacyclic triterpenes are natural compounds which are widely distributed in plants. These natural products have been demonstrated to possess anti-inflammatory properties. Triterpenoids have been reported to possess antioxidant properties, since they prevent lipid peroxidation and suppress superoxide anion generation. The triterpenes have a history of medicinal use in many Asian countries. Oleanolic acid exhibits both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties depending on chemical structure and dose and may be useful in modulating the immune response; further studies are required to confirm the immunomodulatory behaviour of this triterpenoid, and characterise the mechanisms underlying the biphasic nature of some aspects of the inflammatory response. Oleanolic acid is a ubiquitous triterpenoid in plant kingdom, medicinal herbs, and is an integral part of the human diet. During the last decade over 700 research articles have been published on triterpenoids research, reflecting tremendous interest and progress in our understanding of these compounds. This included the isolation and purification of these tritepernoids from various plants and herbs, the chemical modifications to make more effective and water soluble derivatives, the pharmacological research on their beneficial effects, the toxicity studies, and the clinical use of these triterpenoids in various diseases including anticancer chemotherapies.

It is relatively abundant in adult human urine and it is normally relatively benign. It is thought that the presence of this acid is from nutritional sources (i.e. dietary phenylalanine or polyphenols). However, there has been a considerable degree of ambiguity in the origin and/or significance of this compound (PMID:11978597). Recently, it has been reported that HPHPA is actually an abnormal phenylalanine metabolite arising from bacterial metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract. Specifically, HPHPA appears to arise from the action of the anaerobic bacteria Clostridia sp. (PMID:20423563; PMID:24063620). Elevated levels of HPHPA have been reported in the urine of children with autism as well as in adult patients with schizophrenia. It has been proposed that HPHPA may be a bacterial metabolite of m-tyrosine, a tyrosine analog that causes symptoms of autism in experimental animals. Under certain conditions, HPHPA can act as a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of HPHPA are associated with autism and schizophrenia. The mechanism by which HPHPA exerts its toxic effects is not clear.  It may function as a catecholamine analog and disrupt catecholamine signalling, especially in younger individuals. Alternately, HPHPA may function as an amino acid analog to tyrosine and phenylalanine.  High plasma concentrations of phenylalanine (and possibly HPHPA) are known to influence the blood-brain barrier transport of large neutral amino acids. This altered transport is believed to interfere with the function of different cerebral enzyme systems in the developing brain. Studies have shown that higher levels of HPHPA are associated with overgrowth of Clostridia in the gut, including Clostridium difficile, Clostridium sporogenes, Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium calortolerans, Clostridium mangenoyi, Clostridium ghoni, Clostridium bifermentans, Clostridium sordelli.

It is metabolically stable, being excreted in the urine when its level exceeds the renal threshold.

The correlation between this reduction and the amount of glucose present in urine is so close that 1,5 AG can be used as a sensitive, day-to-day, real-time marker of glycemic control. It provides useful information on current glycemic control and is superior to both hemoglobin A1C and fructosamine in detecting near-normoglycemia. 1,5-AG in human plasma has been proposed for several years as a short-term, retrospective marker of glycemic control and seems to be the most suitable parameter for monitoring glucose excursions.

Catechin also belongs to the group of compounds known as flavan-3-ols (or simply flavanols), part of the chemical family of flavonoids. Catechin is one of the 4 catechin known diastereoisomers. Two of the isomers are in trans configuration and are called catechin and the other two are in cis configuration and are called epicatechin. The most common catechin isomer is the (+)-catechin. The other stereoisomer is (-)-catechin or ent-catechin. The most common epicatechin isomer is (-)-epicatechin. Catechin is a very hydrophobic molecule, practically insoluble (in water), and relatively neutral. Catechin is a bitter tasting compound and is associated with the bitterness in tea. Catechin is a plant secondary metabolite. Secondary metabolites are metabolically or physiologically non-essential metabolites that may serve a role as defense or signalling molecules. In some cases they are simply molecules that arise from the incomplete metabolism of other secondary metabolites. Catechin is an antioxidant flavonoid, occurring especially in woody plants as both Catechin and (-)-Catechin (cis) forms. Outside of the human body, Catechin is found, on average, in the highest concentration in foods, such as blackcurrants (Ribes nigrum), evergreen blackberries (Rubus laciniatus), and blackberries (Rubus) and in a lower concentration in dills (Anethum graveolens), hot chocolates, and medlars (Mespilus germanica).

It has practically no stimulant effect on the central nervous system. It was formerly used as a diuretic and in the treatment of angina pectoris and hypertension. Theobromine is a bitter alkaloid of the methylxanthine family, which also includes the similar compounds theophylline and caffeine. Despite its name, the compound contains no bromine. Theobromine is derived from Theobroma, the genus of the cacao tree, which is composed of the Greek roots theo (""God"") and broma (""food""), meaning ""food of the gods"". It is the primary alkaloid found in cocoa and chocolate, and is one of the causes for chocolate's mood-elevating effects. The amount found in chocolate is small enough that chocolate can be safely consumed by humans in large quantities, but animals that metabolize theobromine more slowly, such as cats and dogs, can easily consume enough chocolate to cause chocolate poisoning. Theobromine is a stimulant frequently confused with caffeine. Theobromine has very different effects on the human body from caffeine; it is a mild, lasting stimulant with a mood improving effect, whereas caffeine has a strong, immediate effect and increases stress. In medicine, it is used as a diuretic, vasodilator, and myocardial stimulant. There is a possible association between prostate cancer and theobromine.

It is not endogenously produced by humans. Xylitol is used as a diabetic sweetener which is roughly as sweet as sucrose with 33% fewer calories. Xylitol is naturally found in many fruits (strawberries, plums, raspberries) and vegetables (e.g. cauliflower). Because of fruit and vegetable consumption the human body naturally processes 15 grams of xylitol per day. Xylitol can be produced industrially starting from primary matters rich in xylan which is hydrolyzed to obtain xylose. It is extracted from hemicelluloses present in the corn raids, the almond hulls or the barks of birch (or of the by-products of wood: shavings hard, paper pulp). Of all polyols, it is the one that has the sweetest flavor (it borders that of saccharose). It gives a strong refreshing impression, making xylitol an ingredient of choice for the sugarless chewing gum industry. In addition to his use in confectionery, it is used in the pharmaceutical industry for certain mouthwashes and toothpastes and in cosmetics (creams, soaps, etc.). Xylitol is produced starting from xylose, the isomaltose, by enzymatic transposition of the saccharose (sugar). Xylitol is not metabolized by cariogenic (cavity-causing) bacteria and gum chewing stimulates the flow of saliva; as a result, chewing xylitol gum may prevent dental caries. Chewing xylitol gum for 4 to 14 days reduces the amount of dental plaque. The reduction in the amount of plaque following xylitol gum chewing within 2 weeks may be a transient phenomenon. Chewing xylitol gum for 6 months reduced mutans streptococci levels in saliva and plaque in adults (PMID:17426399, 15964535). Studies have also shown xylitol chewing gum can help prevent acute otitis media (ear aches and infections) as the act of chewing and swallowing assists with the disposal of earwax and clearing the middle ear, while the presence of xylitol prevents the growth of bacteria in the eustachian tubes. Xylitol is well established as a life-threatening toxin to dogs. The number of reported cases of xylitol toxicosis in dogs has significantly increased since the first reports in 2002. Dogs that have ingested foods containing xylitol (greater than 100 milligrams of xylitol consumed per kilogram of bodyweight) have presented with low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which can be life-threatening.

Both naringin and hesperetin, which are the aglycones of naringin and hesperidin, occur naturally in citrus fruits. Naringin is the major flavonoid glycoside in grapefruit and gives grapefruit juice its bitter taste.

N-acyl-alpha amino acids are compounds containing an alpha amino acid which bears an acyl group at its terminal nitrogen atom. N-Acetylserine can also be classified as an alpha amino acid or a derivatized alpha amino acid. Technically, N-Acetylserine is a biologically available N-terminal capped form of the proteinogenic alpha amino acid L-serine. N-acetyl amino acids can be produced either via direct synthesis of specific N-acetyltransferases or via the proteolytic degradation of N-acetylated proteins by specific hydrolases. N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a widespread and highly conserved process in eukaryotes that is involved in protection and stability of proteins (PMID: 16465618).  About 85% of all human proteins and 68% of all yeast proteins are acetylated at their N-terminus (PMID: 21750686). Several proteins from prokaryotes and archaea are also modified by N-terminal acetylation. The majority of eukaryotic N-terminal-acetylation reactions occur through N-acetyltransferase enzymes or NAT‚Äôs (PMID: 30054468).  These enzymes consist of three main oligomeric complexes NatA, NatB, and NatC, which are composed of at least a unique catalytic subunit and one unique ribosomal anchor. The substrate specificities of different NAT enzymes are mainly determined by the identities of the first two N-terminal residues of the target protein. The human NatA complex co-translationally acetylates N-termini that bear a small amino acid (A, S, T, C, and occasionally V and G) (PMID: 30054468). NatA also exists in a monomeric state and can post-translationally acetylate acidic N-termini residues (D-, E-). NatB and NatC acetylate N-terminal methionine with further specificity determined by the identity of the second amino acid.  N-acetylated amino acids, such as N-acetylserine can be released by an N-acylpeptide hydrolase from peptides generated by proteolytic degradation (PMID: 16465618). In addition to the NAT enzymes and protein-based acetylation, N-acetylation of free serine can also occur. Excessive amounts N-acetyl amino acids including N-acetylserine (as well as N-acetylglycine, N-acetylglutamine, N-acetylmethionine, N-acetylglutamate, N-acetylalanine, N-acetylleucine and smaller amounts of N-acetylthreonine, N-acetylisoleucine, and N-acetylvaline) can be detected in the urine with individuals with acylase I deficiency, a genetic disorder (PMID: 16465618). Aminoacylase I is a soluble homodimeric zinc binding enzyme that catalyzes the formation of free aliphatic amino acids from N-acetylated precursors. In humans, Aminoacylase I is encoded by the aminoacylase 1 gene (ACY1) on chromosome 3p21 that consists of 15 exons (OMIM 609924). Individuals with aminoacylase I deficiency will experience convulsions, hearing loss and difficulty feeding (PMID: 16465618). ACY1 can also catalyze the reverse reaction, the synthesis of acetylated amino acids. Many N-acetylamino acids, including N-acetylserine are classified as uremic toxins if present in high abundance in the serum or plasma (PMID: 26317986; PMID: 20613759). Uremic toxins are a diverse group of endogenously produced molecules that, if not properly cleared or eliminated by the kidneys, can cause kidney damage, cardiovascular disease and neurological deficits (PMID: 18287557).",HMDB0002931_nmroned_1917_33139.txt,nmroned,n-acetylserine acetylserine n-acetyl-l-serine (2s)-2-acetamido-3-hydroxypropanoic acid (2s)-2-acetamido-3-hydroxypropionic acid (s)-2-acetamido-3-hydroxypropanoic acid (s)-2-acetamido-3-hydroxypropionic acid n-acetylserine

Erythritol is absorbed from the proximal intestine by passive diffusion in a manner similar to that of many low molecular weight organic molecules which do not have associated active transport systems. The rate of absorption is related to their molecular size. It passes through the intestinal membranes at a faster rate than larger molecules such as mannitol or glucose. In diabetics, erythritol has also been shown to be rapidly absorbed and excreted unchanged in the urine. Following absorption, ingested erythritol is rapidly distributed throughout the body and has been reported to occur in hepatocytes, pancreatic cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells.

It consists of a benzene ring attached to an amino group. Aniline is oily and, although colorless, it can be slowly oxidized and resinified in air to form impurities which can give it a red-brown tint. Its boiling point is 184 degree centigrade and its melting point is -6 degree centegrade. It is a liquid at room temperature. Like most volatile amines, it possesses a somewhat unpleasant odour of rotten fish, and also has a burning aromatic taste; it is a highly acrid poison. It ignites readily, burning with a large smoky flame. Aniline reacts with strong acids to form salts containing the anilinium (or phenylammonium) ion (C6H5-NH3+), and reacts with acyl halides (such as acetyl chloride (ethanoyl chloride), CH3COCl) to form amides. The amides formed from aniline are sometimes called anilides, for example CH3-CO-NH-C6H5 is acetanilide, for which the modern name is N-phenyl ethanamide. Like phenols, aniline derivatives are highly reactive in electrophilic substitution reactions. For example, sulfonation of aniline produces sulfanilic acid, which can be converted to sulfanilamide. Sulfanilamide is one of the sulfa drugs which were widely used as antibacterial in the early 20th century. Aniline was first isolated from the destructive distillation of indigo in 1826 by Otto Unverdorben.

Methylated purines originate from the metabolism of methylxanthines (caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine). Methyluric acids can be distinguished from uric acid via simple methods routinely used in clinical laboratories, requiring the use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Purine derivatives in urinary calculi could be considered markers of abnormal purine metabolism. The content of a purine derivative in stone depends on its average urinary excretion in the general population, similarity to the chemical structure of uric acid, and content of the latter in stone. This suggests that purines in stones represent a solid solution with uric acid as solvent. It is also plausible that methylxanthines, ubiquitous components of the diet and drugs, are involved in the pathogenesis of urolithiasis.

It is one of the earliest uremic toxins isolated and its toxicity identified. Its metabolic origins show that it arose from the oxidation of argininosuccinic acid (ASA) by free radicals. The stimulus for this oxidation, occurring optimally in the presence of the failed kidney, is the rising level of urea which, through enzyme inhibition, results in a decline in hepatic levels of the semi-essential amino acid, arginine. It is further noted that concentrations of GSA in both serum and urine decline sharply in animals and humans exposed to the essential amino acid, methionine. Uremic patients suffer from a defective ability to generate methyl groups due to anorexia, dietary restrictions and renal protein leakage. This leads to the accumulation of homocysteine, a substance known to produce vascular damage. Even in healthy subjects intake of choline together with methionine is insufficient to satisfy total metabolic requirements for methyl groups. In end-stage renal disease, therefore, protein restriction contributes to the build-up of toxins in uremia.

Isoflavones compounds, such as genistein and daidzein, are found in a number of plants, but soybeans and soy products like tofu and textured vegetable protein are the primary food source. Genistein is a natural bioactive compound derived from legumes and has drawn because of its potentially beneficial effects on some human degenerative diseases. It has a weak estrogenic effect and is a well-known non-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor at pharmacological doses. Epidemiological studies show that genistein intake is inversely associated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Data suggests a protective role of genistein in cardiovascular events. However, the mechanisms of the genistein action on vascular protective effects are unclear. Past extensive studies exploring its hypolipidemic effect resulted in contradictory data. Genistein also is a relatively poor antioxidant. However, genistein protects against pro-inflammatory factor-induced vascular endothelial barrier dysfunction and inhibits leukocyte-endothelium interaction, thereby modulating vascular inflammation, a major event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Genistein exerts a non-genomic action by targeting on important signaling molecules in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Genistein rapidly activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase and production of nitric oxide in ECs. This genistein effect is novel since it is independent of its known effects, but mediated by the cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) cascade. Genistein directly stimulates the plasma membrane-associated adenylate cyclases, leading to activation of the cAMP signaling pathway.

Up until recently, daidzein was considered to be one of the most important and most studied isoflavones, however more recently attention has shifted to isoflavone metabolites. Equol represents the main active product of daidzein metabolism, produced via specific microflora in the gut. The clinical effectiveness of soy isoflavones may be a function of the ability to biotransform soy isoflavones to the more potent estrogenic metabolite, equol, which may enhance the actions of soy isoflavones, owing to its greater affinity for estrogen receptors, unique antiandrogenic properties, and superior antioxidant activity. However, not all individuals consuming daidzein produce equol. Only approximately one-third to one-half of the population is able to metabolize daidzein to equol. This high variability in equol production is presumably attributable to interindividual differences in the composition of the intestinal microflora, which may play an important role in the mechanisms of action of isoflavones. But, the specific bacterial species in the colon involved in the production of equol are yet to be discovered. (PMID:18045128, 17579894).

Currently, (+)-limonene is widely used as a flavour and fragrance and is listed to be generally recognized as safe in food by the Food and Drug Administration (21 CFR 182.60 in the Code of Federal Regulations, U.S.A.). Recently, however, (+)-limonene has been shown to cause a male rat-specific kidney toxicity referred to as hyaline droplet nephropathy. Furthermore, chronic exposure to (+)-limonene causes a significant incidence of renal tubular tumours exclusively in male rats. Although (+)-limonene is not carcinogenic in female rats or male and female mice given much higher dosages, the male rat-specific nephrocarcinogenicity of (+)-limonene may raise some concern regarding the safety of (+)-limonene for human consumption. A considerable body of scientific data has indicated that the renal toxicity of (+)-limonene results from the accumulation of a protein, alpha 2u-globulin, in male rat kidney proximal tubule lysosomes. This protein is synthesized exclusively by adult male rats. Other species, including humans, synthesize proteins that share significant homology with alpha 2u-globulin. However, none of these proteins, including the mouse equivalent of alpha 2u-globulin, can produce this toxicity, indicating a unique specificity for alpha 2u-globulin. With chronic exposure to (+)-limonene, the hyaline droplet nephropathy progresses and the kidney shows tubular cell necrosis, granular cast formation at the corticomedullary junction, and compensatory cell proliferation. Both (+)-limonene and cis-d-limonene-1,2-oxide (the major metabolite involved in this toxicity) are negative in vitro mutagenicity screens. Therefore, the toxicity-related renal cell proliferation is believed to be integrally involved in the carcinogenicity of (+)-limonene as persistent elevations in renal cell proliferation may increase fixation of spontaneously altered DNA or serve to promote spontaneously initiated cells. The scientific data demonstrates that the tumorigenic activity of (+)-limonene in male rats is not relevant to humans. The three major lines of evidence supporting the human safety of (+)-limonene are (1) the male rat specificity of the nephrotoxicity and carcinogenicity; (2) the pivotal role that alpha 2u-globulin plays in the toxicity, as evidenced by the complete lack of toxicity in other species despite the presence of structurally similar proteins; and (3) the lack of genotoxicity of both (+)-limonene and d-limonene-1,2-oxide, supporting the concept of a nongenotoxic mechanism, namely, sustained renal cell proliferation (PMID:2024047).",HMDB0003375_nmroned_1996_33493.txt,nmroned,"(+)-limonene (+)-(4r)-limonene (+)-(r)-limonene (+)-4-isopropenyl-1-methylcyclohexene (+)-limonene (4r)-1-methyl-4-isopropenylcyclohex-1-ene (4r)-4-isopropenyl-1-methylcyclohexene (r)-(+)-limonene (r)-(+)-p-mentha-1,8-diene (r)-1-methyl-4-(1-methylethenyl)cyclohexene (r)-4-isopropenyl-1-methyl-1-cyclohexene (r)-p-mentha-1,8-diene 4betah-p-mentha-1,8-diene d-(+)-limonene d-limonen aisa 5203-l (+)limonene dipentene (-)-limonene 1-methyl-4-(1-methylethenyl)cyclohexene limonene limonene, (+-)-isomer (d)-limonene 4-mentha-1,8-diene limonene, (r)-isomer (+)-dipentene (+)-alpha-limonene (+)-p-mentha-1,8-diene (+)-α-limonene (4r)-(+)-limonene (4r)-1-methyl-4-(1-methylethenyl)cyclohexene (4r)-limonene (r)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (r)-limonene 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-yl-cyclohexene (+)-(r)-4-isopropenyl-1-methylcyclohexene d limonene 4 mentha 1,8 diene (r)-4-isopropenyl-1-methylcyclohexene d-limonene d-limonene (4r)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene r-limonene p-mentha-1,8-diene (±)-dipentene (±)-limonene (±)-alpha-limonene (±)-α-limonene 1,8-p-menthadiene 1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene 1-methyl-4-isopropenyl-1-cyclohexene 1-methyl-4-isopropenylcyclohexene 1-methyl-p-isopropenyl-1-cyclohexene 4-isopropenyl-1-methyl-1-cyclohexene 4-isopropenyl-1-methylcyclohexene dl-limonene dipenten limonen alpha-limonene α-limonene"

D-serine was only thought to exist in bacteria until relatively recently. D-serine was the second D amino acid discovered to naturally exist in humans. The first one was D-aspartate. D-serine is synthesized from L-serine by serine racemase (SRR), and it is degraded by D-amino acid oxidase (DAO). It is found in high abundance in the brain. D-serine acts on the glycine binding site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and modulates glutamate-mediated receptor activation. For the receptor to open, glutamate and either glycine or D-serine must bind to it. In fact, D-serine is a more potent agonist at the glycine site on the NMDAR than glycine itself. The importance of D-serine in mammalian brain function is apparent from extensive investigations reported and reviewed over the past decade, including roles in synaptic plasticity and memory. D-serine is also implicated in the pathophysiology and therapy of several psychiatric and neurological conditions including schizophrenia and glioma. In schizophrenia, there is evidence that D-serine levels are decreased, a deficiency that may contribute to the proposed NMDAR hypofunction of the disorder and that has led to D-serine replenishment as a novel therapeutic strategy.",HMDB0003406_nmroned_1963_33340.txt,nmroned,d-serine (2r)-2-amino-3-hydroxypropanoic acid (r)-2-amino-3-hydroxy-propionic acid (r)-2-amino-3-hydroxypropanoic acid d-serin dsn (2r)-2-amino-3-hydroxypropanoate (r)-2-amino-3-hydroxy-propionate (r)-2-amino-3-hydroxypropanoate dl-serine serine d-form

Selenomethionine is the major seleno-compound in cereal grains (wheat grain, maize, and rice), soybeans, and enriched yeast. Seleno-compounds present in plants may have a profound effect on the health of animals and human subjects. It is now known that the total Se content cannot be used as an indication of its efficacy, but knowledge of individual selenocompounds is necessary to fully assess the significance. Thus, speciation of the seleno-compounds has moved to the forefront. Since animals and man are dependent upon plants for their nutritional requirements, this makes the types of seleno-compounds in plants even more critical. Se enters the food chain through incorporation into plant proteins, mostly as selenocysteine and selenomethionine at normal Se levels. There are two possible pathways for the catabolism of selenomethionine. One is the transsulfuration pathway via selenocystathionine to produce selenocysteine, which in turn is degraded into H2Se by the enzyme beta-lyase. The other pathway is the transamination-decarboxylation pathway.

Quercetin glycosides are converted to phenolic acids as they pass through the gastrointestinal tract. Quercetin has neither been confirmed scientifically as a specific therapeutic for any condition nor been approved by any regulatory agency. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved any health claims for quercetin. Nevertheless, the interest in dietary flavonoids has grown after the publication of several epidemiological studies showing an inverse correlation between dietary consumption of flavonols and flavones and reduced incidence and mortality from cardiovascular disease and cancer. In recent years, a large amount of experimental and some clinical data have accumulated regarding the effects of flavonoids on the endothelium under physiological and pathological conditions. The meta-analysis of seven prospective cohort studies concluded that the individuals in the top third of dietary flavonol intake are associated with a reduced risk of mortality from coronary heart disease as compared with those in the bottom third, after adjustment for known risk factors and other dietary components.

(PMID:17168665). The flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds found as integral components of the human diet. They are universally present as constituents of flowering plants, particularly of food plants. The flavonoids are phenyl substituted chromones (benzopyran derivatives) consisting of a 15-carbon basic skeleton (C6-C3-C6), composed of a chroman (C6-C3) nucleus (the benzo ring A and the heterocyclic ring C), also shared by the tocopherols, with a phenyl (the aromatic ring B) substitution usually at the 2-position. Different substitutions can typically occur in the rings, A and B. Several plants and spices containing flavonoid derivatives have found application as disease preventive and therapeutic agents in traditional medicine in Asia for thousands of years. The selection of a particular food plant, plant tissue or herb for its potential health benefits appears to mirror its flavonoid composition. The much lower risk of colon, prostate and breast cancers in Asians, who consume more vegetables, fruits and tea than populations in the Western hemisphere do, raises the question of whether flavonoid components mediate the protective effects of diets rich in these foodstuffs by acting as natural chemopreventive and anticancer agents. An impressive body of information exists on the antitumoral action of plant flavonoids. In vitro work has concentrated on the direct and indirect actions of flavonoids on tumor cells, and has found a variety of anticancer effects such as cell growth and kinase activity inhibition, apoptosis induction, suppression of the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases and of tumor invasive behavior. Furthermore, some studies have reported the impairment of in vivo angiogenesis by dietary flavonoids. Experimental animal studies indicate that certain dietary flavonoids possess antitumoral activity. The hydroxylation pattern of the B ring of the flavones and flavonols, such as luteolin seems to critically influence their activities, especially the inhibition of protein kinase activity and antiproliferation. The different mechanisms underlying the potential anticancer action of plant flavonoids await further elucidation. Certain dietary flavonols and flavones targeting cell surface signal transduction enzymes, such as protein tyrosine and focal adhesion kinases, and the processes of angiogenesis appear to be promising candidates as anticancer agents. Further in vivo studies of these bioactive constituents is deemed necessary in order to develop flavonoid-based anticancer strategies. In view of the increasing interest in the association between dietary flavonoids and cancer initiation and progression, this important field is likely to witness expanded effort and to attract and stimulate further vigorous investigations (PMID:16097445).",HMDB0005800_nmroned_2027_33634.txt,nmroned,"luteolin 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-4-benzopyrone 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-4h-1-benzopyran-4-one 3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone digitoflavone flacitran luteolol salifazide 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-4h-benzopyrone-4-one 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-4h-chromen-4-one luteoline 3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxy-flavone 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-4h-benzopyran-4-one 3’,4’,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone 5,7,3’,4’-tetrahydroxyflavone cyanidenon"

Since its discovery in invertebrates, free D-aspartate (D-Asp) has been identified in a variety of organisms, including microorganisms, plants, and lower animals, mammals and humans. D-Asp in mammalian tissues is present in specific cells, indicating the existence of specific molecular components that regulate D-Asp levels and localization in tissues. In the rat adrenal medulla, D-Asp is closely associated with adrenaline-cells (A-cells), which account for approximately 80% of the total number of chromaffin cells in the tissue, and which make and store adrenaline. D-Asp appears to be absent from noradrenaline-cells (NA-cells), which comprise approximately 20% of the total number of chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla, and which make and store noradrenaline. D-aspartate oxidase (EC 1.4.3.1, D-AspO), which catalyzes oxidative deamination of D-Asp, appears to be present only in NA-cells, suggesting that the lack of D-Asp in these cells is due to D-Asp oxidase-mediated metabolism of D-Asp. In the rat adrenal cortex, the distribution of D-Asp changes during development. It has been suggested that developmental changes in the localization of D-Asp reflects the participation of D-Asp in the development and maturation of steroidogenesis in rat adrenal cortical cells. D-Asp is involved in steroid hormone synthesis and secretion in mammals as well. D-Asp is synthesized intracellularly, most likely by Asp racemase (EC 5.1.1.13). Endogenous D-Asp apparently has two different intracellular localization patterns: cytoplasmic and vesicular. D-Asp release can occur through three distinct pathways: 1) spontaneous, continuous release of cytoplasmic D-Asp, which is not associated with a specific stimulus; 2) release of cytoplasmic D-Asp via a volume-sensitive organic anion channel that connects the cytoplasm and extracellular space; 3) exocytotic discharge of vesicular D-Asp. D-Asp can be released via a mechanism that involves the L-Glu transporter. D-Asp is thus apparently in dynamic flux at the cellular level to carry out its physiological function(s) in mammals (PMID:16755369).",HMDB0006483_nmroned_2041_33699.txt,nmroned,"d-aspartic acid (r)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (r)-2-aminosuccinic acid aspartic acid d-form d-asparaginsaeure das (r)-2-aminobutanedioate (r)-2-aminosuccinate aspartate d-form d-aspartate d aspartate d aspartic acid (-)-aspartic acid (2r)-2-aminobutanedioate (2r)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (r)-aspartic acid 1-amino-1,2-carboxyethane aspartic acid d-(-)-aspartic acid delta-(-)-aspartic acid delta-asparaginsaeure delta-aspartate delta-aspartic acid lopac-alpha-9256 tocris-0213"

NNK is abundantly present in cigarette smoke (20-280 ng/cigarette). Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) do not convert nicotine to NNK due to their lower operating temperatures. NNK is a procarcinogen. This means it must be activated by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2A6 and CYP2B6) to become a carcinogen (PMID:24830349). NNK can also be activated by myeloperoxidase (MPO) and epoxide hydrolase (EPHX1). All activation processes lead to the formation of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol from NNK, which is called NNAL (PMID:24830349).

This enzyme is responsible for the hydrolysis of the deoxyribose N-glycosidic bond to excise 3-methyladenine, and 7-methylguanine from the damaged DNA polymer formed by alkylation lesions. Base excision repair (BER) is a cellular mechanism that repairs damaged DNA throughout the cell cycle. Repairing DNA sequence errors is necessary so that mutations are not propagated or to remove lesions that may lead to breaks in the DNA during replication. Single bases in DNA can be chemically mutated, for example by deamination or alkylation, resulting in incorrect base-pairing, and consequently, mutations in the DNA. Base excision repair involves flipping the mutated base out of the DNA helix and repairing the base alone. There are two main enzymes used, DNA glycosylases and AP endonucleases. The DNA glycosylase is used to break the beta-N glycosidic bond to create an AP site. AP endonuclease recognizes this site and nicks the damaged DNA on the 5' side (upstream) of the AP site creating a free 3'-OH. DNA polymerase, Pol I (human pol beta), extends the DNA from the free 3'-OH using its exonuclease activity to replace the nucleotide of the damaged base, as well as a few downstream, followed by sealing of the new DNA strand by DNA ligase. In mammalian cells, this is done by LigIII in complex with the scaffold protein XRCC1. Usually, BER is divided into short-patch repair (where a single nucleotide is replaced) or long-patch repair (where 2-10 nucleotides are replaced). Mammalian long-patch repair includes PCNA and pol delta/epsilon for nucleotide resynthesis, FEN1 to cut of the 'flap' including the damaged base, and LigI.",HMDB0011614_nmroned_2045_33719.txt,nmroned,7-methyladenine 7-methyladenine 6-amino-7-methylpurine 7-methyl-7h-purin-6-amine 7-methyl-7h-purin-6-amine (acd/name 4.0) 7-methyl-7h-purin-6-ylamine (acd/name 4.0) 7-methyl-n7-methyladenine

It is used to treat certain bacterial infections, most often bacteria causing middle ear infections, tonsillitis, throat infections, laryngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and sinusitis. It is also effective against certain sexually transmitted infectious diseases, such as non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis. Like other macrolide antibiotics, azithromycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of the bacterial 70S ribosome. Binding inhibits peptidyl transferase activity and interferes with amino acid translocation during the process of translation. Its effects may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal depending of the organism and the drug concentration. Its long half-life, which enables once-daily dosing, and shorter administration durations is a property distinct from other macrolides. Azithromycin is derived from erythromycin; however, it differs chemically from erythromycin in that a methyl-substituted nitrogen atom is incorporated into the lactone ring, thus making the lactone ring 15-membered.

Cytarabine is isolated from the mushroom Xerocomus nigromaculatus of unknown palatability. Cytarabine is an antineoplastic anti-metabolite used in the treatment of several forms of leukemia including acute myelogenous leukemia and meningeal leukemia. Cytarabine is an antimetabolite antineoplastic agent that inhibits the synthesis of DNA. Its actions are specific for the S phase of the cell cycle to stop normal cell development and division. Cytarabine is metabolized intracellularly into its active triphosphate form (cytosine arabinoside triphosphate). This metabolite then damages DNA by multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of alpha-DNA polymerase, inhibition of DNA repair through an effect on beta-DNA polymerase, and incorporation into DNA. The latter mechanism is probably the most important. Cytotoxicity is highly specific for the S phase of the cell cycle. Cytarabine is a chemotherapy agent used mainly in the treatment of hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is also known as ara C. Cytosine arabinoside is an antimetabolic agent with the chemical name of 1 -arabinofuranosylcytosine. Its mode of action is due to its rapid conversion into cytosine arabinoside triphosphate, which damages DNA when the cell cycle holds in the S phase (synthesis of DNA). Rapidly dividing cells, which require DNA replication for mitosis, are therefore most affected. Cytosine arabinoside also inhibits both DNA and RNA polymerases and nucleotide reductase enzymes needed for DNA synthesis",HMDB0015122_nmroned_5194_2733715.txt,nmroned,"cytarabine 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine 4-amino-1-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl-2(1h)-pyrimidinone ara-c arabinocytosine arabinoside c citarabina cytarabinum cytosine arabinoside cytosine-1-beta-d-arabinofuranoside cytosine-beta-d-arabinofuranoside depocyt 1-b-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine 4-amino-1-b-d-arabinofuranosyl-2(1h)-pyrimidinone 4-amino-1-β-d-arabinofuranosyl-2(1h)-pyrimidinone cytosine-1-b-d-arabinofuranoside cytosine-1-β-d-arabinofuranoside cytosine-b-d-arabinofuranoside cytosine-β-d-arabinofuranoside (beta-d-arabinofuranosyl)cytosine 1-arabinofuranosylcytosine 1-beta -d-arabinofaranosylcytosine 1-beta -d-arabinofuranosyl-4-amino-2(1h)pyrimidinone 1-beta -d-arabinofuranosylcytosine 1-beta-d-arabinofaranosylcytosine 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl-4-amino-2(1h)pyrimidinone 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl-cytosine 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine, cytosine arabinoside 1-beta-d-arabinosyl-cytosine 1-beta-d-arabinosylcytosine 1beta -arabinofuranasylcytosine 1beta -d-arabinofuranosylcytosine 1beta -d-arabinosylcytosine 1beta-arabinofuranasylcytosine 1beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine 1beta-d-arabinosylcytosine 2(1h)-pyrimidinone, 4-amino-1- -d-arabinofuranosyl 4-amino-1-arabinofuranosyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyrimidin 4-amino-1-arabinofuranosyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyrimidine 4-amino-1-b-d-arabinofuranosyl-2-(1h)-pyrimidinone 4-amino-1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylpyrimidin-2(1h)-one alexan arabinocytidine arabinofuranosylcytosine arabinosylcytosine arabitin arac aracytidine aracytin aracytine arafcyt beta -arabinosylcytosine beta -cytosine arabinoside beta -d-arabinosylcytosine beta-ara c beta-arabinosylcytosine beta-cytosine arabinoside beta-d-arabinosylcytosine cytarabin cytarabina cytarabine liposome injection cytarabinoside cytonal cytosar cytosar-u cytosine 1-beta-d-arabinofuranoside cytosine arabinofuranoside cytosine arabinose cytosine beta-d-arabinofuranoside cytosine beta-d-arabinoside cytosine, beta -d-arabinoside cytosine, beta-d-arabinoside cytosine-1-beta-d-arabinofuranoside hydrochloride cytosine-beta -arabinoside cytosine-beta -d-arabinofuranoside cytosine-beta-arabinoside cytosinearabinoside depocyte erpalfa iretin spongocytidine tarabine udicil arabinoside, cytosine cytosaru hydrochloride, cytarabine cytarabine hydrochloride cytosar u ara c beta ara c cytarabine"
